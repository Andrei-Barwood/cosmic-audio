      i was forbid to walk inside the forest because i had my foot with mushrooms,
      i washed with clothes in the swamp and my feet were full of bacterias they looked
      horrible and it was so fucking painful to walk so i decided to take the bad luck shoes,
      which where the ones mom gave me for christmas, she said nothing but enjoy, she was truly happy.
      in my mind i was so lonely i was so empty i was so cold i never realized how that pair of shoes came to me
      and furthermore nobody ever said welcome, my mom's girlfriend "said enjoy them you look pretty
      wearing them". i started walking like an idiot but slower and afraid,
      i stoped at the entrance of the forest and started screaming wild words in eevry direction,
      i said "help me", i said "find me", i said "touch me" and she appeared out of nowhere, i remember
      she was disguised as a fairy i was so confused at using disguises in fact so much that i only started
      wearing them when i was living in vegas and every day was a new disguise fucking around playing
      some random movie character, she was dressed as a fairy and from time to time i will get confused
      as usual with everyone at home when they start flying and i can't explain why people can fly
      and why i cannot. so i was confused and she said find me, she ran inside the forest and i started
      remembering when i was lost in the dusseldorf forest full of trees, i was sentenced to a week
      of mental hospital in a court in germany because of vandalism while painting a graffiti,
      the court decided i was too confused to even understand what the charges were, OF COURSE!! nobody
      can explain why people fly!! it's hard to understand it!!! and i hate it!! don't do it!! stop it!!

  while i was serving time one of the doctors called me and said "what is it today?" i had no idea
  my heart was dying because i heard how she was tortured in a room below the train tracks,
  in the room next to the platform where people wait, you keep walking to the forbidden access area
  and then there's these staircase to a lower floor, they were torturing her inside that room, and i
  wanted a graffiti right there at the right time. i came from Dresden where i met a beautiful old lady
  who said she could shave her p*ssy for me to lick it if i was right with it, she did that to me while
  i was asleep, i only remember her lubbed skin and how slippery it was when she got me hard and sticks me
  inside her, i was so shocked, but she used something in the food to put me into an eternal sleep, weeks
  later i was in dusseldorf trying this graffiti of the tortured, next morning i was sleeping in one of the
  staircases of the train station i was so tired, the cops took me and the shit happened, i felt the need
  out of nowhere to make a drawing of a musical instrument, in my bag i had my laptop and a notebook with
  hand drawings, one of them was a giant forest with millions of small leafs falling from the sky.
  the doctors where like 20 to 25 years old medicine students checking that all prisoners where in good health
  i went to bed in my room and started sleeping, the nightmare of this girl i knew in dresden came to me
  i was hard as rock my dick was about to break, and i felt her hands and saw her face but right on time
  i woke up and her face was deformed like the face of a teacher i had back when i was 11 years old, i said
  "oh she disappeared flying, how crazy!" somebody called my name and two girls came to my room to
  find me, that somebody was this girl i met in dresden she was supposed to be the girlfriend of one
  of the brothers with which i played blues back in "the city of the cats", she was supposed to be her
  wife, but things seemed wrong. she was the one calling my voice, but she was dressed like a doctor,
  she was a lot thinner and smaller she asks all the questions "whats your name, whats your age, where do you live, and why are you here"
  i said i needed my freedom because i needed to go to berlin to visit someone, that i was a musical composer and out of all
  seriousness that i made a mistake that i swear i wont make again. she said "you are free to go", i thought she would kiss my mouth,
  but she didn't, walking out of the hospital there was a giant labyrinth to get to the main gates, when i was outside i was waiting
  for one of the cars to stop and take me somewhere. I saw a road to a giant garden, i tried crossing the street but it was strange,
  i was under the effect of the medication the give you while serving time, i managed to get to the entrance of that garden.
  when i try to remember what happened to me the night i had the nightmare about her in the hospital i can only see the following picture:
  green leaves everywhere like in my drawing, she clearly read my notebook and was allowing me to see anything i draw, i never got inside
  the garden but i know what it is on the inside; just when i was about to enter that giant garden a friend who worked in the deutsche welle
  radio station called my phone and said "stop dude, come back..." i walk back and told him i was so lost and two cities away from home,
  i was living in bonn, he call a friend in dusseldorf to save me it was strange but it all solved itself, the lady was on facebook,
  i tried adding her to contact her and explain my story to her with the excuse of me creating a record label and in need of help with
  judicial advise for certain documents, she said "i only know about german laws i can't help you" when i read that my heart broke in two,
  everytime when i was about to contact her or write her a message she will stop my though by saying please don't contact me
  and i never understood what she was saying, maybe something about "you are attacking me, please stop"
</div>

<div class="para text-scroll">
  this little fairy went inside the forest and i started walking right behind her shadow, at some point i realized i was at the center
  of a lake that had the waters too tranquil and it scared the shit out of me, you know the saying
  that goes "god please save me from the calm waters because they are the worst, of the trubulent ones i'm strong enough" i didn't know
  where to find her and she appeared flying and said i forgot about you, but if you truly wanna find me, chase this star, i look to the sun
  and next to it there was a star, but that particular forest is said to had a family of 14 pumas in the wild so it could easy be a scam
  and a kidnapper found his perfect prey, with bad luck shoes some cash and a family willing to pay millions for a ransom... but i was
  so alone in my interior i decided to chase the star, when i found the place she appeared flying and said "give me your hand",
  i walked with her inside a small set of trees with a tiny lake inside, she said "take off your clothes im gonna clean your soul" we did it,
  we drink water from the forbidden fountain, i couldn't escape it was so hot the water i can feel burning my skin right in the scars
  and feel how tantric the bleeding was, i was bleeding fire, and my nose grow so hard i could barely stand the pressure, at some point when
  everything disappeared she said, there is a war raising, we should never lose contact while terrain is hard men, stay in touch, i had a friend
  who is a high rank cop, when i was walking outside the garden to find my bad luck car, with my bad luck shoes with my chest full of scars
  he called me and said "you are in big, big, big trouble, they're sending a patrol to catch drive slow" i went as he said, i had to drive like
  200 km to get to my farm, leaving the city there was a military checkpoint regulating the traffic, my friend was there and turned on and off
  the lights on me, like "you made the worst mistake" driving i was so scared of what i did to another human being, the parfume of her skin
  still in my mouth, my scars, my fears, and a difficult set of 7 mountains up a giant hill full of curves, it is a nightmare to drive
  through it, there's just so many accidents in that road a year, people always kill themselves there because its too curvy and dangerous
  one needs to stay focused and concentrated but i was antyhing so scared and freezing i arrived home and i felt so strange, there was no one
  i could talk about it, i was so silent and it was so strange, then they stated the pandemic of the world because of what we did, they closed
  every door to me, i knew it was us and nothing else, in fact they said it was a time bomb waiting to explode and they were ready to
  implode my lungs for being a man who just met a fairy in a fucking forest i draw myself, what right do they believe they have over my
  absolute creation, do they think they are omnipresent like i am? bastards whoever they are...

  i felt so threatened by her that i erased her contact of my whatsapp like a scared kid gives his candy to a thief, i promised never go insdie
  the forest finding for someone, with every matharfackar on patrol to chase me i had to lay low and tried reaching her with letters, but
  i know she will never read them, i tried drinking beers but she nevers draw herself, i tried drawing her and she reapeared saying horrible things to me,
  i tried erasing her and she went out flying, i tried flying and fall from a 5th floor, ended up bleeding so much i had to ask people to
  please donate blood to me. i tried crying but it was impossible the reasons were so obvious i had to admit i can't fly, from time to time
  i hear a similar voice with a similar face saying "i was here all the time baby" and i say to myself "just calm down it will vanish soon enough..."
  from that day i want everything to vanish as quickly as possible, i promised her heaven with clouds, water and gardens full of fruits but
  could never stand my word, and the world went against my spirit when i tried to give her the promise i said that day, deal, i am so
  overpowered you wouldn't believe how explosive i became when i discovered myself i wanted eevrything to burn, i did it once in the city of cats
  i can burn it twice wherever i am, so that's my story, and the moral of the story? the moral is "don't push me, im superluminal being far beyond human comprehension"
  i am so vast and infinite when it comes to creation i will create the worst inferno for each person who requests it with no mercy whatsoever,
  i wish i could hear her voice more often, and not having to rely on my drawings or imagination to touch her mouth with my tongue, i fucked everything
  but i was alone and nobody helped me, nobody ever listened to me, nobody ever waited for me, nobody ever tried for me, i rather draw a
  labyrinth and get lost tonight, sorry if you are sophie and your reading this, but i had a surgery, for removing my heart i forgot the actual one somewhere else
  someone replaced it with an upside down white triangle figure that don't beat, but flows light through it, blood is too heavy and too
  painful for my age, so i use light rays, it's a new and beauitful method of evolving, soon people will start using prosthetics to erase
  feelings from the human body, soon you will remove your knees and use prosthetic ones to run faster, prosthetic brain to code faster and better,
  eyes, ears, THX said my name is not "barbudo andres" he said they made a mistake with the translation of "burn wood" by writing "bar wood" and
  so when read in spanish makes no sense, he also said removing the tongue for removing the tastes can be interesting, you don't depend on
  nature, you only depend on the science of empty space, the science of empty place, the science of empty sound, a completely empty anecoic chamber
  where no one can hear you, see you, or touch you, my conlcusion was: trapped inside why would you need senses, in such a chamber,
  senses will only betray you. i hate to say things the way they are, but i need to take them all out.
