<p align="center"><strong>THE DUTIES OF A HIPPARCH</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Commander of Cavalry at Athens</strong></p>
<p>I Your first duty is to offer sacrifice, petitioning the gods to grant</p>
<p>you such good gifts as shall enable you in thought, word, and deed</p>
<p>to discharge your office in the manner most acceptable to Heaven, and</p>
<p>with fullest increase to yourself, and friends, and to the state at</p>
<p>large of affection, glory, and wide usefulness. The goodwill of</p>
<p>Heaven so obtained, you shall proceed to mount your troopers,</p>
<p>taking care that the full complement which the law demands is reached,</p>
<p>and that the normal force of cavalry is not diminished. There will</p>
<p>need to be a reserve of remounts, or else a deficiency may occur at</p>
<p>any moment, looking to the fact that some will certainly succumb to</p>
<p>old age, and others, from one reason or another, prove unserviceable.</p>
<p>But now suppose the complement of cavalry is levied, the duty will</p>
<p>devolve on you of seeing, in the first place, that your horses are</p>
<p>well fed and in condition to stand their work, since a horse which</p>
<p>cannot endure fatigue will clearly be unable to overhaul the foeman or</p>
<p>effect escape; and in the second place, you will have to see to it</p>
<p>the animals are tractable, since, clearly again, a horse that will not</p>
<p>obey is only fighting for the enemy and not his friends. So, again, an</p>
<p>animal that kicks when mounted must be cast; since brutes of that sort</p>
<p>may often do more mischief than the foe himself. Lastly, you must pay</p>
<p>attention to the horses’ feet, and see that they will stand being</p>
<p>ridden over rough ground. A horse, one knows, is practically useless</p>
<p>where he cannot be galloped without suffering.</p>
<p>And now, supposing that your horses are all that they ought to be,</p>
<p>like pains must be applied to train the men themselves. The trooper,</p>
<p>in the first place, must be able to spring on horseback easily–a feat</p>
<p>to which many a man has owed his life ere now. And next, he must be</p>
<p>able to ride with freedom over every sort of ground, since any</p>
<p>description of country may become the seat of war. When, presently,</p>
<p>your men have got firm seats, your aim should be to make as many</p>
<p>members of the corps as possible not only skilled to hurl the javelin</p>
<p>from horseback with precision, but to perform all other feats expected</p>
<p>of the expert horseman. Next comes the need to arm both horse and man</p>
<p>in such a manner as to minimise the risk of wounds, and yet to</p>
<p>increase the force of every blow delivered. This attended to, you</p>
<p>must contrive to make your men amenable to discipline, without which</p>
<p>neither good horses, nor a firm seat, nor splendour of equipment will</p>
<p>be of any use at all.</p>
<p>The general of cavalry, as patron of the whole department, is</p>
<p>naturally responsible for its efficient working. In view, however, of</p>
<p>the task imposed upon that officer had he to carry out these various</p>
<p>details single-handed, the state has chosen to associate with him</p>
<p>certain coadjutors in the persons of the phylarchs (or tribal</p>
<p>captains), and has besides imposed upon the senate a share in the</p>
<p>superintendence of the cavalry. This being so, two things appear to me</p>
<p>desirable; the first is, so to work upon the phylarch that he shall</p>
<p>share your own enthusiasm for the honour of the corps; and</p>
<p>secondly, to have at your disposal in the senate able orators,</p>
<p>whose language may instil a wholesome fear into the knights</p>
<p>themselves, and thereby make them all the better men, or tend to</p>
<p>pacify the senate on occasion and disarm unseasonable anger.</p>
<p>The above may serve as memoranda of the duties which will claim</p>
<p>your chief attention. How the details in each case may best be carried</p>
<p>out is a further matter, which I will now endeavour to explain.</p>
<p>As to the men themselves–the class from which you make your pick of</p>
<p>troopers–clearly according to the law you are bound to enrol “the</p>
<p>ablest” you can find “in point of wealth and bodily physique”; and “if</p>
<p>not by persuasion, then by prosecution in a court of law.” And for</p>
<p>my part, I think, if legal pressure is to be applied, you should apply</p>
<p>it in those cases where neglect to prosecute might fairly be ascribed</p>
<p>to interested motives; since if you fail to put compulsion on the</p>
<p>greater people first, you leave a backdoor of escape at once to those</p>
<p>of humbler means. But there will be other cases; say, of young men</p>
<p>in whom a real enthusiasm for the service may be kindled by recounting</p>
<p>to them all the brilliant feats of knighthood; while you may disarm</p>
<p>the opposition of their guardians by dwelling on the fact that, if not</p>
<p>you, at any rate some future hipparch will certainly compel them to</p>
<p>breed horses, owing to their wealth; whereas, if they enter the</p>
<p>service during your term of office, you will undertake to deter</p>
<p>their lads from mad extravagance in buying horses, and take pains</p>
<p>to make good horsemen of them without loss of time; and while pleading</p>
<p>in this strain, you must endeavour to make your practice correspond</p>
<p>with what you preach.</p>
<p>To come to the existing body of knights, it would tend, I</p>
<p>think, to better rearing and more careful treatment of their horses if</p>
<p>the senate issued a formal notice that for the future twice the amount</p>
<p>of drill will be required, and that any horse unable to keep up will</p>
<p>be rejected. And so, too, with regard to vicious horses, I should like</p>
<p>to see an edict promulgated to the effect that all such animals will</p>
<p>be rejected. This threat would stimulate the owners of such brutes to</p>
<p>part with them by sale, and, what is more, to exercise discretion at</p>
<p>the time of purchase. So, too, it would be a good thing if the same</p>
<p>threat of rejection were made to include horses that kick on the</p>
<p>exercising-grounds, since it is impossible to keep such animals in the</p>
<p>ranks; and in case of an advance against a hostile force at any</p>
<p>point, they must perforce trail in the rear, so that, thanks to</p>
<p>the vice of the animal which he bestrides, the trooper himself is</p>
<p>rendered useless.</p>
<p>With a view to strengthening the horses’ feet: if any one has an</p>
<p>easier or more simple treatment to suggest, by all means let it be</p>
<p>adopted; but for myself, as the result of experience, I maintain that</p>
<p>the proper course is to lay down a loose layer of cobbles from the</p>
<p>road, a pound or so in weight, on which the horse should be put to</p>
<p>stand, when taken from the manger to be groomed. The point is,</p>
<p>that the horse will keep perpetually moving first one foot and then</p>
<p>another on the stones, whilst being rubbed down or simply because he</p>
<p>is fidgeted by flies. Let any one try the experiment, and, I venture</p>
<p>to predict, not only will he come to trust my guidance, but he will</p>
<p>see his horse’s hoofs grow just as round and solid as the cobbles.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, your horses are all that horses ought to be, how is</p>
<p>the trooper to attain a like degree of excellence? To that question I</p>
<p>will now address myself. The art of leaping on to horseback is one</p>
<p>which we would fain persuade the youthful members of the corps to</p>
<p>learn themselves; though, if you choose to give them an</p>
<p>instructor, all the greater credit to yourself. And as to the</p>
<p>older men you cannot do better than accustom them to mount, or rather</p>
<p>to be hoisted up by aid of some one, Persian fashion.</p>
<p>With a view to keeping a firm seat on every sort of ground, it may be</p>
<p>perhaps be thought a little irksome to be perpetually marching out,</p>
<p>when there is no war; but all the same, I would have you call your</p>
<p>men together and impress upon them the need to train themselves, when</p>
<p>they ride into the country to their farms, or elsewhere, by leaving</p>
<p>the high road and galloping at a round pace on ground of every</p>
<p>description. This method will be quite as beneficial to them as</p>
<p>the regular march out, and at the same time not produce the same sense</p>
<p>of tedium. You may find it useful also to remind them that the state</p>
<p>on her side is quite willing to expend a sum of nearly forty</p>
<p>talents yearly, so that in the event of war she may not have to</p>
<p>look about for cavalry, but have a thoroughly efficient force to hand</p>
<p>for active service. Let these ideas be once instilled into their</p>
<p>minds, and, mark my words, your trooper will fall with zest to</p>
<p>practising horsemanship, so that if ever the flame of war burst out he</p>
<p>may not be forced to enter the lists a raw recruit, unskilled to fight</p>
<p>for fame and fatherland or even life itself.</p>
<p>It would be no bad thing either, to forewarn your troopers that one</p>
<p>day you will take them out yourself for a long march, and lead them</p>
<p>across country over every kind of ground. Again, whilst practising the</p>
<p>evolutions of the rival cavalry display, it will be well to gallop</p>
<p>out at one time to one district and again to another. Both men and</p>
<p>horses will be benefited.</p>
<p>Next, as to hurling the javelin from horseback, the best way to secure</p>
<p>as wide a practice of the art as possible, it strikes me, would be to</p>
<p>issue an order to your phylarchs that it will be their duty to put</p>
<p>themselves at the head of the marksmen of several tribes, and to ride</p>
<p>out to the butts for practice. In this way a spirit of emulation will</p>
<p>be roused–the several officers will, no doubt, be eager to turn out</p>
<p>as many marksmen as they can to aid the state.</p>
<p>And so too, to ensure that splendour of accoutrement which the force</p>
<p>requires, the greatest help may once again be looked for from the</p>
<p>phylarchs; let these officers but be persuaded that from the public</p>
<p>point of view the splendid appearance of their squadrons will</p>
<p>confer a title to distinction far higher than that of any personal</p>
<p>equipment. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that they will be deaf to</p>
<p>such an argument, since the very desire to hold the office of phylarch</p>
<p>itself proclaims a soul alive to honour and ambition. And what is</p>
<p>more, they have it in their power, in accordance with the actual</p>
<p>provisions of the law, to equip their men without the outlay of a</p>
<p>single penny, by enforcing that self-equipment out of pay which</p>
<p>the law prescribes.</p>
<p>But to proceed. In order to create a spirit of obedience in your</p>
<p>subordinates, you have two formidable instruments; as a matter of</p>
<p>plain reason you can show them what a host of blessings the word</p>
<p>discipline implies; and as a matter of hard fact you can, within the</p>
<p>limits of the law, enable the well-disciplined to reap advantage,</p>
<p>while the undisciplined are made to feel the pinch at every turn.</p>
<p>But if you would rouse the emulation of your phylarchs, if you would</p>
<p>stir in each a personal ambition to appear at the head of his own</p>
<p>squadron in all ways splendidly appointed, the best incentive will be</p>
<p>your personal example. You must see to it that your own bodyguard</p>
<p>are decked with choice accoutrement and arms; you must enforce on them</p>
<p>the need to practise shooting pertinaciously; you must expound to them</p>
<p>the theory of the javelin, yourself an adept in the art through</p>
<p>constant training.</p>
<p>Lastly, were it possible to institute and offer prizes to the several</p>
<p>tribal squadrons in reward for every excellence of knighthood known to</p>
<p>custom in the public spectacles of our city, we have here, I think, an</p>
<p>incentive which will appeal to the ambition of every true Athenian.</p>
<p>How small, in the like case of our choruses, the prizes offered, and</p>
<p>yet how great the labour and how vast the sums expended! But we</p>
<p>must discover umpires of such high order that to win their verdict</p>
<p>will be as precious to the victor as victory itself.</p>
<p>II Given, then, that your troopers are thoroughly trained in all the</p>
<p>above particulars, it is necessary, I presume, that they should</p>
<p>further be instructed in a type of evolution the effect of which will</p>
<p>show itself not only in the splendour of the great processions in</p>
<p>honour of the gods, but in the manouvres of the exercising-ground; in</p>
<p>the valorous onslaught of real battle when occasion calls; and in the</p>
<p>ease with which whole regiments will prosecute their march, or cross a</p>
<p>river, or thread a defile without the slightest symptom of confusion.</p>
<p>What this formation is–essential, at least in my opinion, to the</p>
<p>noblest execution of their several duties–I will now, without delay,</p>
<p>endeavour to explain.</p>
<p>We take as our basis, then, the constitutional division of ten</p>
<p>tribes. Given these, the proper course, I say, is to appoint, with</p>
<p>the concurrence of the several phylarchs, certain decadarchs</p>
<p>(file-leaders) to be selected from the men ripest of age and</p>
<p>strength, most eager to achieve some deed of honour and to be known to</p>
<p>fame. These are to form your front-rank men; and after these, a</p>
<p>corresponding number should be chosen from the oldest and the most</p>
<p>sagacious members of the squadron, to form the rear-rank of the files</p>
<p>or decads; since, to use an illustration, iron best severs iron when</p>
<p>the forefront of the blade is strong and tempered, and the momentum</p>
<p>at the back is sufficient.</p>
<p>The interval between the front and rear-rank men will best be filled</p>
<p>supposing that the decadarchs are free to choose their own supports,</p>
<p>and those chosen theirs, and so on following suit; since on this</p>
<p>principle we may expect each man to have his trustiest comrade at his</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>As to your lieutenant, it is every way important to appoint a good</p>
<p>man to this post, whose bravery will tell; and in case of need at any</p>
<p>time to charge the enemy, the cheering accents of his voice will</p>
<p>infuse strength into those in front; or when the critical moment of</p>
<p>retreat arrives, his sage conduct in retiring will go far, we may well</p>
<p>conclude, towards saving his division.</p>
<p>An even number of file-leaders will admit of a greater number of equal</p>
<p>subdivisions than an odd.</p>
<p>The above formation pleases me for two good reasons: in the first</p>
<p>place, all the front-rank men are forced to act as officers; and</p>
<p>the same man, mark you, when in command is somehow apt to feel that</p>
<p>deeds of valour are incumbent on him which, as a private, he ignores;</p>
<p>and in the next place, at a crisis when something calls for action on</p>
<p>the instant, the word of command passed not to privates but to</p>
<p>officers takes speedier effect.</p>
<p>Supposing, then, a regiment of cavalry drawn up in this formation:</p>
<p>just as the squadron-leaders have their several positions for the</p>
<p>march assigned them by the commander, so the file-</p>
<p>leaders will depend upon the captain for the order passed along the</p>
<p>line in what formation they are severally to march; and all being</p>
<p>prearranged by word of mouth, the whole will work more smoothly than</p>
<p>if left to chance–like people crowding out of a theatre to their</p>
<p>mutual annoyance. And when it comes to actual encounter greater</p>
<p>promptitude will be displayed: supposing the attack is made in front,</p>
<p>by the file-leaders who know that this is their appointed post; or in</p>
<p>case of danger suddenly appearing in rear, then by the rear-rank men,</p>
<p>whose main idea is that to desert one’s post is base. A want of</p>
<p>orderly arrangement, on the contrary, leads to confusion worse</p>
<p>confounded at every narrow road, at every passage of a river; and when</p>
<p>it comes to fighting, no one of his own free will assigns himself his</p>
<p>proper post in face of an enemey.</p>
<p>The above are fundamental matters not to be performed without the</p>
<p>active help of every trooper who would wish to be a zealous and</p>
<p>unhesitating fellow-worker with his officer.[11]</p>
<p>III I come at length to certain duties which devolve upon the general of</p>
<p>cavalry himself in person: and first and foremost, it concerns him to</p>
<p>obtain the favour of the gods by sacrifices in behalf of the state</p>
<p>cavalry; and in the next place to make the great procession at the</p>
<p>festivals a spectacle worth seeing; and further, with regard to all</p>
<p>those public shows demanded by the state, wherever held, whether in</p>
<p>the grounds of the Acadamy or the Lyceum, at Phaleron or within the</p>
<p>hippodrome, it is his business as commander of the knights to see that</p>
<p>every pageant of the sort is splendidly exhibited.</p>
<p>But these, again, are memoranda. To the question how the several</p>
<p>features of the pageant shall receive their due impress of beauty, I</p>
<p>will now address myself.</p>
<p>And first to speak of the Processions. These will, I think, be</p>
<p>rendered most acceptable to Heaven and to earth’s spectators were the</p>
<p>riders to ride round the Agora and temples, commencing from the</p>
<p>Hermae, and pay honour to the sacred beings, each in turn, whose</p>
<p>shrines and statues are there congregated. (Thus in the great</p>
<p>Dionysia the choruses embrace their gracious service to the other</p>
<p>gods and to the Twelve with circling dance.) When the circuit is</p>
<p>completed, and the riders are back again in front of the Hermae, it</p>
<p>would add, I think, to the beauty of the scene if at this point</p>
<p>they formed in companies of tribes, and giving their horses rein,</p>
<p>swept forward at the gallop to the Eleusinion. Nor must I omit to note</p>
<p>the right position of the lance, to lessen as far as possible the risk</p>
<p>of mutual interference. Each trooper should hold his lance straight</p>
<p>between the ears of his charger, which in proportion to the</p>
<p>distinctness given to the weapon will rouse terror, and at the same</p>
<p>time create a vague idea of multitudinousness.</p>
<p>As soon as they have ceased from the charge at full gallop, the pace</p>
<p>should at once be changed; and now, with footing slow, let them</p>
<p>retrace their course back to the temples. In this way every detail</p>
<p>characteristic of knightly pageantry[9] will have been displayed to</p>
<p>the delight of god and man. That our knights are not accustomed to</p>
<p>these actual evolutions, I am well aware; but I also recognise the</p>
<p>fact that the performances are good and beautiful and will give</p>
<p>pleasure to spectators. I do not fail to note, moreover, that novel</p>
<p>feats of horsemanship have before now been performed by our knights,</p>
<p>when their commanders have had the ability to get their wishes readily</p>
<p>complied with.</p>
<p>But now, let us suppose it is the occasion of the march-past, in</p>
<p>the grounds of the Lyceum, before the javelin-throwing. The scene</p>
<p>would gain in beauty if the tribal squadrons were to ride in line of</p>
<p>columns as if for battle, in two divisions, five squadrons in the</p>
<p>one and five in the other, with the hipparch and the phylarchs at</p>
<p>their head, in such formation as to allow the whole breadth of the</p>
<p>racecourse to be filled. Then, as soon as they have gained the top</p>
<p>of the incline, which leads down to the theatre opposite, it would, I</p>
<p>think, be obviously useful here to show the skill with which your</p>
<p>troopers can gallop down a steep incline with as broad a front as</p>
<p>the nature of the ground permits. I am quite clear that your troopers,</p>
<p>if they can trust their own skill in galloping, will take kindly to</p>
<p>such an exhibition; while as certainly, if unpractised, they must look</p>
<p>to it that the enemy does not give them a lesson in the art some day,</p>
<p>perforce.</p>
<p>To come to the test manouvres. The order in which the men will</p>
<p>ride with showiest effect on these occasions has been already</p>
<p>noted. As far as the leader is himself concerned, and presuming he</p>
<p>is mounted on a powerful horse, I would suggest that he should each</p>
<p>time ride round on the outer flank; in which case he will himself be</p>
<p>kept perpetually moving at a canter, and those with him, as they</p>
<p>become the wheeling flank, will, by turns, fall into the same pace,</p>
<p>with this result: the spectacle presented to the senate will be that</p>
<p>of an ever rapidly moving stream of cavaliers; and the horses having,</p>
<p>each in turn, the opportunity to recover breath, will not be overdone.</p>
<p>On occasions when the display takes place in the hippodrome, the</p>
<p>best arrangement would be, in the first place, that the troops should</p>
<p>fill the entire space with extended front, so forcing out the mob of</p>
<p>people from the centre; and secondly, that in the sham fight</p>
<p>which ensues, the tribal squadrons, swiftly pursuing and retiring,</p>
<p>should gallop right across and through each other, the two hipparchs</p>
<p>at their head, each with five squadrons under him. Consider the effect</p>
<p>of such a spectacle: the grim advance of rival squadrons front to</p>
<p>front; the charge; the solemn pause as, having swept across the</p>
<p>hippodrome, they stand once more confronting one another; and then the</p>
<p>trumpet sounds, whereat a second and yet swifter hostile advance, how</p>
<p>fine the effect!–and once again they are at the halt; and once again</p>
<p>the trumpet sounds, and for the third time, at the swiftest pace of</p>
<p>all, they make a final charge across the field, before dismissal;</p>
<p>after which they come to a halt en masse, in battle order; and, as now</p>
<p>customary, ride up to salute the senate, and disband. These</p>
<p>evolutions will at once approve themselves, I think, not only for</p>
<p>their novelty, but for their resemblacne to real warfare. The notion</p>
<p>that the hipparch is to ride at a slower pace than his phylarchs, and</p>
<p>to handle his horse precisely in their style, seems to me below the</p>
<p>dignity of the office.</p>
<p>When the cavalry parade takes place on the hard-trodden[20] ground of</p>
<p>the Academy, I have the following advice to give. To avoid being</p>
<p>jolted off his horse at any moment, the trooper should, in charging,</p>
<p>lean well back,[21] and to prevent his charger stumbling, he should</p>
<p>while wheeling hold his head well up, but along a straight stretch he</p>
<p>should force the pace. Thus the spectacle presented to the senate will</p>
<p>combine the elements of beauty and of safety.</p>
<p>IV To pass to a different topic: on the march, the general will need to</p>
<p>exercise a constant forethought to relieve the horses’ backs and the</p>
<p>troopers’ legs, by a judicious interchange of riding and of marching.</p>
<p>Wherein consists the golden mean, will not be hard to find; since</p>
<p>“every man a standard to himself,” applies, and your sensations are</p>
<p>an index to prevent your fellows being overdone through inadvertence.</p>
<p>But now supposing you are on the march in some direction, and it is</p>
<p>uncertain whether you will stumble on the enemy, your duty is to rest</p>
<p>your squadrons in turn; since it will go hard with you, if the enemy</p>
<p>come to close quarters when the whole force is dismounted. Or,</p>
<p>again, suppose the roads are narrow, or you have to cross a defile,</p>
<p>you will pass, by word of mouth, the command to diminish the front;</p>
<p>or given, again, you are debouching on broad roads, again the word of</p>
<p>command will pass by word of mouth, to every squadron, “to increase</p>
<p>their front”; or lastly, supposing you have reached flat country, “to</p>
<p>form squadron in order of battle.” If only for the sake of practice,</p>
<p>it is well to go through evolutions of the sort; besides which it</p>
<p>adds pleasure to the march thus to diversify the line of route with</p>
<p>cavalry mavouvres.</p>
<p>Supposing, however, you are off roads altogether and moving fast over</p>
<p>difficult ground, no matter whether you are in hostile or in friendly</p>
<p>territory, it will be useful if the scouts attached to squadrons[5]</p>
<p>rode on in advance, their duty being, in case of encountering pathless</p>
<p>clefts or gullies, to work round on to practicable ground, and to</p>
<p>discover at what point the troopers may effect a passage, so that</p>
<p>whole ranks may not go blindly roaming.</p>
<p>Again, if there is prospect of danger on the march, a prudent general</p>
<p>can hardly show his wisdom better than by sending out advanced patrols</p>
<p>in front of the ordinary exploring parties to reconnoitre every inch</p>
<p>of ground minutely. So to be apprised of the enemy’s position in</p>
<p>advance, and at as great a distance off as possible, cannot fail to be</p>
<p>useful, whether for purposes of attack or defence; just as it is</p>
<p>useful also to enforce a halt at the passage of a river or some other</p>
<p>defile, so that the men in rear may not knock their horses all to bits</p>
<p>in endeavouring to overtake their leader. These are precepts known, I</p>
<p>admit, to nearly all the world, but it is by no means every one who</p>
<p>will take pains to apply them carefully.[7]</p>
<p>It is the business of the hipparch to take infinite precautions while</p>
<p>it is still peace, to make himself acquainted with the details, not</p>
<p>only of his own, but of the hostile territory; or if, as may well</p>
<p>betide, he personally should lack the knowledge, he should invite the</p>
<p>aid of others–those best versed in the topography of any district.</p>
<p>Since there is all the difference in the world between a leader</p>
<p>acquainted with his roads and one who is not; and when it comes to</p>
<p>actual designs upon the enemy, the difference between knowing and not</p>
<p>knowing the locality can hardly be exaggerated.</p>
<p>So, too, with regard to spies and intelligencers. Before war commences</p>
<p>your business is to provide yourself with a supply of people friendly</p>
<p>to both states, or maybe merchants (since states are ready to receive</p>
<p>the importer of goods with open arms); sham deserters may be found</p>
<p>occasionally useful. Not, of course, that the confidence you feel</p>
<p>in your spies must ever cause you to neglect outpost duty; indeed your</p>
<p>state of preparation should at any moment be precisely what it ought</p>
<p>to be, supposing the approach or the imminent arrival of the enemy</p>
<p>were to be announced. Let a spy be ever so faithful, there is always</p>
<p>the risk he may fail to report his intelligence at the critical</p>
<p>moment, since the obstacles which present themselves in war are not to</p>
<p>be counted on the fingers.</p>
<p>But to proceed to another topic. The enemy is less likely to get wind</p>
<p>of an advance of cavalry, if the orders for march were passed from</p>
<p>mouth to mouth rather than announced by voice of herald, or public</p>
<p>notice. Accordingly, in addition to this method of ordering</p>
<p>the march by word passed along the line, the appointment of file-</p>
<p>leaders seems desirable, who again are to be supplemented by section-</p>
<p>leaders, so that the number of men to whom each petty officer has</p>
<p>to transmit an order will be very few; while the section-leaders</p>
<p>will deploy and increase the front, whatever the formation, without</p>
<p>confusion, whenever there is occasion for the movement.</p>
<p>When an advanced guard is needed, I say for myself I highly approve of</p>
<p>secret pickets and outposts, if only because in supplying a guard to</p>
<p>protect your friends you are contriving an ambuscade to catch the</p>
<p>enemy. Also the outposts will be less exposed to a secret attack,</p>
<p>being themselves unseen, and yet a source of great alarm to the enemy;</p>
<p>since the bare knowledge that there are outposts somewhere, though</p>
<p>where precisely no man knows, will prevent the enemy from feeling</p>
<p>confident, and oblige him to mistrust every tenable position. An</p>
<p>exposed outpost, on the contrary, presents to the broad eye of day its</p>
<p>dangers and also its weaknesses. Besides which, the holder of a</p>
<p>concealed outpost can always place a few exposed vedettes beyond his</p>
<p>hidden pickets, and so endeavour to decoy the enemy into an ambuscade.</p>
<p>Or he may play the part of trapper with effect by placing a second</p>
<p>exposed outpost in rear of the other; a device which may serve to take</p>
<p>in the unwary foeman quite as well as that before named.</p>
<p>Indeed I take it to be the mark of a really prudent general never to</p>
<p>run a risk of his own choosing, except where it is plain to him</p>
<p>beforehand, that he will get the better of his adversary. To play into</p>
<p>the enemy’s hands may more fitly be described as treason to one’s</p>
<p>fellow-combatants than true manliness. So, too, true generalship</p>
<p>consists in attacking where the enemy is weakest, even if the point be</p>
<p>some leagues distant. Severity of toil weighs nothing in the scale</p>
<p>against the danger of engaging a force superior to your own.</p>
<p>Still, if on any occasion the enemy advance in any way to place</p>
<p>himself between fortified points that are friendly to you, let him be</p>
<p>never so superior in force, your game is to attack on whichever flank</p>
<p>you can best conceal your advance, or, still better, on both flanks</p>
<p>simultaneously; since, while one detachment is retiring after</p>
<p>delivering its attack, a charge pressed home from the opposite quarter</p>
<p>cannot fail to throw the enemy into confusion and to give safety to</p>
<p>your friends.</p>
<p>How excellent a thing it is to endeavour to ascertain an enemy’s</p>
<p>position by means of spies and so forth, as in ancient story; yet best</p>
<p>of all, in my opinion, is it for the commander to try to seize some</p>
<p>coign of vantage, from which with his own eyes he may descry the</p>
<p>movements of the enemy and watch for any error on his part.</p>
<p>Whatever may be snatched by ruse, thief fashion, your business is</p>
<p>to send a competent patrol to seize; or again where capture by coup de</p>
<p>main is practicable, you will despatch a requisite body of troops</p>
<p>to effect a coup de main. Or take the case: the enemy is on the march</p>
<p>in some direction, and a portion of his force becomes detached from</p>
<p>his main body or through excess of confidence is caught straggling; do</p>
<p>not let the opportunity escape, but make it a rule always to pursue a</p>
<p>weaker with a stronger force. These, indeed, are rules of</p>
<p>procedure, which it only requires a simple effort of the mind to</p>
<p>appreciate. Creatures far duller of wit than man have this ability:</p>
<p>kites and falcons, when anything is left unguarded, pounce and carry</p>
<p>it off and retire into safety without being caught; or wolves, again,</p>
<p>will hunt down any quarry left widowed of its guard, or thieve what</p>
<p>they can in darksome corners. In case a dog pursues and overtakes</p>
<p>them, should he chance to be weaker the wolf attacks him, or if</p>
<p>stronger, the wolf will slaughter his quarry and make off. At</p>
<p>other times, if the pack be strong enough to make light of the</p>
<p>guardians of a flock, they will marshal their battalions, as it were,</p>
<p>some to drive off the guard and others to effect the capture, and so</p>
<p>by stealth or fair fight they provide themselves with the necessaries</p>
<p>of life. I say, if dumb beasts are capable of conducting a raid with</p>
<p>so much sense and skill, it is hard if any average man cannot prove</p>
<p>himself equally intelligent with creatures which themselves fall</p>
<p>victims to the craft of man.</p>
<p>V Here is another matter which every horseman ought to know, and that is</p>
<p>within what distance a horse can overhaul a man on foot; or the</p>
<p>interval necessary to enable a slower horse to escape one more fleet.</p>
<p>It is the business rather of the cavalry general to recognise at a</p>
<p>glance the sort of ground on which infantry will be superior to</p>
<p>cavalry and where cavalry will be superior to infantry. He should be a</p>
<p>man of invention, ready of device to turn all circumstances to</p>
<p>account, so as to give at one time a small body of cavalry the</p>
<p>appearance of a larger, and again a large the likeness of a smaller</p>
<p>body; he should have the craft to appear absent when close at hand,</p>
<p>and within striking distance when a long way off; he should know</p>
<p>exactly not only how to steal an enemy’s position, but by a master</p>
<p>stroke of cunning to spirit his own cavalry away, and, when least</p>
<p>expected, deliver his attack. Another excellent specimen of</p>
<p>inventiveness may be seen in the general’s ability, while holding a</p>
<p>weak position himself, to conjure up so lively an apprehension in the</p>
<p>enemy that he will not dream of attacking; or conversely, when, being</p>
<p>in a strong position himself, he can engender a fatal boldness in the</p>
<p>adversary to venture an attack. Thus with the least cost to yourself,</p>
<p>you will best be able to catch your enemy tripping.</p>
<p>But to avoid suspicion of seeming to prescribe impossible feats, I</p>
<p>will set down, in so many words, the procedure in certain crucial</p>
<p>instances.</p>
<p>The best safeguard against failure in any attempt to enforce pursuit</p>
<p>or conduct a retreat lies in a thorough knowledge of your horse’s</p>
<p>powers. But how is this experience to be got? Simply by paying</p>
<p>attention to their behaviour in the peaceable manouvres of the sham</p>
<p>fight, when there is no real enemy to intervene–how the animals come</p>
<p>off, in fact, and what stamina they show in the various charges and</p>
<p>retreats.</p>
<p>Or suppose the problem is to make your cavalry appear numerous. In the</p>
<p>first place, let it be a fundamental rule, if possible, not to attempt</p>
<p>to delude the enemy at close quarters; distance, as it aids illusion,</p>
<p>will promote security. The next point is to bear in mind that a mob of</p>
<p>horses clustered together (owing perhaps to the creatures’ size) will</p>
<p>give a suggestion of number, whereas scattered they may easily be</p>
<p>counted.</p>
<p>Another means by which you may give your troop an appearance of</p>
<p>numerical strength beyond reality consists in posting, in and out</p>
<p>between the troopers, so many lines of grooms who should carry</p>
<p>lances if possible, or staves at any rate to look like lances–a plan</p>
<p>which will serve alike whether you mean to display your cavalry force</p>
<p>at the halt or are deploying to increase front; in either case,</p>
<p>obviously the bulk and volume of the force, whatever your formation,</p>
<p>will appear increased. Conversely, if the problem be to make large</p>
<p>numbers appear small, supposing you have ground at command adapted to</p>
<p>concealment, the thing is simple: by leaving a portion of your men</p>
<p>exposed and hiding away a portion in obscurity, you may effect your</p>
<p>object. But if the ground nowhere admits of cover, your best course</p>
<p>is to form your files into ranks one behind the other, and wheel</p>
<p>them round so as to leave intervals between each file; the troopers</p>
<p>nearest the enemy in each file will keep their lances erect, and the</p>
<p>rest low enough not to show above.</p>
<p>To come to the next topic: you may work on the enemy’s fears by the</p>
<p>various devices of mock ambuscades, sham relief parties, false</p>
<p>information. Conversely, his confidence will reach an overweening</p>
<p>pitch, if the idea gets abroad that his opponents have troubles of</p>
<p>their own and little leisure for offensive operations.</p>
<p>But over and beyond all that can be written on the subject–</p>
<p>inventiveness is a personal matter, beyond all formulas–the true</p>
<p>general must be able to take in, deceive, decoy, delude his adversary</p>
<p>at every turn, as the particular occasion demands. In fact, there is</p>
<p>no instrument of war more cunning than chicanery; which is not</p>
<p>surprising when one reflects that even little boys, when playing, “How</p>
<p>many (marbles) have I got in my hand?” are able to take one another</p>
<p>in successfully. Out goes a clenched fist, but with such cunning that</p>
<p>he who holds a few is thought to hold several; or he may present</p>
<p>several and appear to be holding only a few. Is it likely that a grown</p>
<p>man, giving his whole mind to methods of chicanery, will fail of</p>
<p>similar inventiveness? Indeed, when one comes to consider what is</p>
<p>meant by advantages snatched in war, one will find, i think, that the</p>
<p>greater part of them, and those the more important, must be attributed</p>
<p>in some way or other to displays of craft; which things being so, a</p>
<p>man had better either not attempt to exercise command, or, as part and</p>
<p>parcel of his general equipment, let him pray to Heaven to enable him</p>
<p>to exercise this faculty and be at pains himself to cultivate his own</p>
<p>inventiveness.</p>
<p>A general, who has access to the sea, may exercise the faculty as</p>
<p>follows: he may either, whilst apparently engaged in fitting out his</p>
<p>vessels, strike a blow on land;[9] or with a make-believe of some</p>
<p>aggressive design by land, hazard an adventure by sea.[10]</p>
<p>I consider it to be the duty of the cavalry commander to point out</p>
<p>clearly to the state authority the essential weakness of a force of</p>
<p>cavalry unaided by light infantry, as opposed to cavalry with foot-</p>
<p>soldiers attached. It is duty also, having got his footmen, to</p>
<p>turn the force to good account. It is possible to conceal them</p>
<p>effectively, not only between the lines, but in rear also of the</p>
<p>troopers–the mounted soldier towering high above his follower on</p>
<p>foot.</p>
<p>With regard to these devices and to any others which invention may</p>
<p>suggest towards capturing the foeman by force or fraud, I have one</p>
<p>common word of advice to add, which is, to act with God, and then</p>
<p>while Heaven propitious smiles, fortune will scarcely dare to</p>
<p>frown.</p>
<p>At times there is no more effective fraud than a make-believe of</p>
<p>over-caution alien to the spirit of adventure. This itself will put</p>
<p>the enemy off his guard and ten to one will lure him into some</p>
<p>egregious blunder; or conversely, once get a reputation for</p>
<p>foolhardiness established, and then with folded hands sit feigning</p>
<p>future action, and see what a world of trouble you will thereby cause</p>
<p>your adversary.</p>
<p>VI But, after all, no man, however great his plastic skill, can hope to</p>
<p>mould and shape a work of art to suit his fancy, unless the stuff on</p>
<p>which he works be first prepared and made ready to obey the</p>
<p>craftsman’s will. Nor certainly where the raw material consists of</p>
<p>men, will you succeed, unless, under God’s blessing, these same men</p>
<p>have been prepared and made ready to meet their officer in a friendly</p>
<p>spirit. They must come to look upon him as of greater sagacity than</p>
<p>themselves in all that concerns encounter with the enemy. This</p>
<p>friendly disposition on the part of his subordinates, one must</p>
<p>suppose, will best be fostered by a corresponding sympathy on the part</p>
<p>of their commander towards the men themselves, and that not by simple</p>
<p>kindness but by the obvious pains he takes on their behalf, at one</p>
<p>time to provide them with food, and at another to secure safety of</p>
<p>retreat, or again by help of outposts and the like, to ensure</p>
<p>protection during rest and sleep.</p>
<p>When on active service the commander must prove himself</p>
<p>conspicuously careful in the matter of forage, quarters, water-supply,</p>
<p>outposts, and all other requisites; forecasting the future and</p>
<p>keeping ever a wakeful eye in the interest of those under him; and in</p>
<p>case of any advantage won, the truest gain which the head of affairs</p>
<p>can reap is to share with his men the profits of success.</p>
<p>Indeed, to put the matter in a nutshell, there is small risk a general</p>
<p>will be regarded with contempt by those he leads, if, whatever he may</p>
<p>have to preach, he shows himself best able to perform.</p>
<p>Beginning with the simple art of mounting on horseback, let him so</p>
<p>train himself in all particulars of horsemanship that, to look at him,</p>
<p>the men must see their leader is a horseman who can leap a trench</p>
<p>unscathed or scale a parapet, or gallop down a bank, and hurl a</p>
<p>javelin with the best. These are accomplishments which one and all</p>
<p>will pave the way to make contempt impossible. If, further, the men</p>
<p>shall see in their commander one who, with the knowledge how to act,</p>
<p>has force of will and cunning to make them get the better of the</p>
<p>enemy; and if, further, they have got the notion well into their heads</p>
<p>that this same leader may be trusted not to lead them recklesssly</p>
<p>against the foe, without the help of Heaven, or despite the auspices–</p>
<p>I say, you have a list of virtues which will make those under his</p>
<p>command the more obedient to their ruler.</p>
<p>VII If prudence may be spoken of as the one quality distinctive of true</p>
<p>generalship, there are two respects in which a general of cavalry at</p>
<p>Athens should pre-eminently excel. Not only must he show a dutiful</p>
<p>submission to the gods; but he must possess great fighting qualities,</p>
<p>seeing that he has on his borders a rival cavalry equal to his own in</p>
<p>number and backed by a large force of heavy infantry.[1] So that, if</p>
<p>he undertake to invade the enemy’s territory unsupported by the other</p>
<p>forces of the city–in dealing with two descriptions of forces</p>
<p>single-handed, he and his cavalry must look for a desperate adventure;</p>
<p>or to take the converse case, that the enemy invades the soil of</p>
<p>Attica, to begin with, he will not invade at all, unless supported by</p>
<p>other cavalry besides his own and an infantry force sufficient to</p>
<p>warrant the supposition that no force on our side can cope with him.</p>
<p>Now, to deal with this vast hostile array, if only the city will</p>
<p>determine to sally out en masse to protect her rural districts, the</p>
<p>prospect is fair. Under God, our troopers, if properly cared for, are</p>
<p>the finer men; our infantry of the line are no less numerous, and as</p>
<p>regards physique, if it comes to that, not one whit inferior, while in</p>
<p>reference to moral qualities, they are more susceptible to the spur of</p>
<p>a noble ambition, if only under God’s will they be correctly trained.</p>
<p>Or again, as touching pride of ancestry, what have Athenians to fear</p>
<p>as against Boeotians on that score?</p>
<p>But suppose the city of Athens determine to betake herself to her</p>
<p>navy, as in the old days when the Lacedaemonians, leagued with the</p>
<p>rest of Hellas, brought invasion; and is content once more simply</p>
<p>to protect her walls through thick and thin. As to protecting what</p>
<p>lies outside the city wall she looks to her cavalry for that; and</p>
<p>single-handed her troopers must do desperate encounter against the</p>
<p>united forces of the enemy. I say, under these circumstances, we shall</p>
<p>need in the first place the strong support of Heaven; and in the</p>
<p>second place, well will it be for us if our cavalry commander prove</p>
<p>himself a consummate officer. Indeed, he will have need of large</p>
<p>wisdom to deal with a force so vastly superior in numbers, and of</p>
<p>enterprise to strike when the critical moment comes.</p>
<p>He must also, as it appears to me, be capable of great physical</p>
<p>endurance; since clearly, if he has to run full tilt against an</p>
<p>armament present, as we picture, in such force that not even our whole</p>
<p>state cares to cope with it, it is plain he must accept whatever fate</p>
<p>is due, where might is right, himself unable to retaliate.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, he elect to guard the territory outside the</p>
<p>walls with a number just sufficient to keep a look-out on the</p>
<p>enemy, and to withdraw into safe quarters from a distance whatever</p>
<p>needs protection–a small number, be it observed, is just as capable</p>
<p>of vedette duty, as well able, say, to scan the distant horizon, as a</p>
<p>large; and by the same token men with no great confidence in</p>
<p>themselves or in their horses are not ill-qualified to guard, or</p>
<p>withdraw within shelter the property of friends; since fear, as the</p>
<p>proverb has it, makes a shrewd watchman. The proposal, therefore, to</p>
<p>select from these a corps of observation will most likely prove true</p>
<p>strategy. But what then of the residue not needed for outpost duty? If</p>
<p>any one imagines he has got an armament, he will find it miserably</p>
<p>small, and lacking in every qualification necessary to risk an open</p>
<p>encounter.</p>
<p>But let him make up his mind to employ it in guerilla war, and he will</p>
<p>find the force quite competent for that, I warrant. His business, so</p>
<p>at least it seems to me, will be to keep his men perpetually in</p>
<p>readiness to strike a blow, and without exposing himself, to play</p>
<p>sentinel, waiting for any false move on the part of the hostile</p>
<p>armament. And it is a way with soldiers, bear in mind, the more</p>
<p>numerous they are, the more blunders they commit. They must needs</p>
<p>scatter of set purpose in search of provisions; or through the</p>
<p>disorder incidental to a march, some will advance and others lag</p>
<p>behind, beyond a proper limit. Blunders like these, then, our hipparch</p>
<p>must not let pass unpunished (unless he wishes the whole of Attica to</p>
<p>become a gigantic camp);[10] keeping his single point steadily in</p>
<p>view, that when he strikes a blow he must be expeditious and retire</p>
<p>before the main body has time to rally to the rescue.</p>
<p>Again, it frequently happens on the march, that an army will get into</p>
<p>roads where numbers are no advantage. Again, in the passage of rivers,</p>
<p>defiles, and the like, it is possible for a general with a head on his</p>
<p>shoulders to hang on the heels of an enemy in security, and to</p>
<p>determine with precision[11] the exact number of the enemy he will</p>
<p>care to deal with. Occasionally the fine chance occurs to atack the</p>
<p>foe while encamping or breakfasting or supping, or as the men turn out</p>
<p>of bed: seasons at which the soldier is apt to be unharnessed–the</p>
<p>hoplite for a shorter, the cavalry trooper for a longer period.[12]</p>
<p>As to vedettes and advanced outposts, you should never cease planning</p>
<p>and plotting against them. For these in their turn, as a rule, are apt</p>
<p>to consist of small numbers, and are sometimes posted at a great</p>
<p>distance from their own main body. But if after all it turns out that</p>
<p>the enemy are well on their guard against all such attempts, then, God</p>
<p>helping, it would be a feat of arms to steal into the enemy’s country,</p>
<p>first making it your business to ascertain his defences, the</p>
<p>number of men at this, that, and the other point, and how they are</p>
<p>distributed throughout the country. For there is no booty so splendid</p>
<p>as an outpost so overmastered; and these frontier outposts are</p>
<p>especially prone to be deceived, with their propensity to give chase</p>
<p>to any small body they set eyes on, regarding that as their peculiar</p>
<p>function. You will have to see, however, in retiring that your line of</p>
<p>retreat is not right into the jaws of the enemy’s reliefs hastening to</p>
<p>the scene of action.</p>
<p>VIII It stands to reason, however, that in order to be able to inflict real</p>
<p>damage upon a greatly superior force, the weaker combatant must</p>
<p>possess such a moral superiority over the other as shall enable him to</p>
<p>appear in the position of an expert, trained in all the feats of</p>
<p>cavalry performance in the field, and leave his enemy to play the part</p>
<p>of raw recruits or amateurs.</p>
<p>And this end may be secured primarily on this wise: those who are to</p>
<p>form your guerilla bands must be so hardened and inured to the</p>
<p>saddle that they are capable of undergoing all the toils of a</p>
<p>campaign. That a squadron (and I speak of horse and man alike)</p>
<p>should enter these lists in careless, disorderly fashion suggests the</p>
<p>idea of a troop of women stepping into the arena to cope with male</p>
<p>antagonists.</p>
<p>But reverse the picture. Suppose men and horses to have been taught</p>
<p>and trained to leap trenches and scale dykes, to spring up banks, and</p>
<p>plunge from heights without scathe, to gallop headlong at full speed</p>
<p>adown a steep: they will tower over unpractised opponents as the birds</p>
<p>of the air tower over creatures that crawl and walk. Their feet are</p>
<p>case-hardened by constant training, and, when it comes to tramping</p>
<p>over rough ground, must differ from the uninitiated as the sound man</p>
<p>from the lame. And so again, when it comes to charging and retiring,</p>
<p>the onward-dashing gallop, the well-skilled, timely retreat, expert</p>
<p>knowledge of the ground and scenery will assert superiority over</p>
<p>inexpertness like that of eyesight over blindness.</p>
<p>Nor should it be forgotten, that in order to be in thorough efficiency</p>
<p>the horses must not only be well fed and in good condition, but at the</p>
<p>same time so seasoned by toil that they will go through their work</p>
<p>without the risk of becoming broken-winded. And lastly, as bits and</p>
<p>saddle-cloths (to be efficient) need to be attached by straps, a</p>
<p>cavalry general should never be without a good supply, whereby at a</p>
<p>trifling expense he may convert a number of nonplussed troopers into</p>
<p>serviceable fighting men.</p>
<p>But if any one is disposed to dwell on the amount of trouble it will</p>
<p>cost him, if he is required to devote himself to horsemanship so</p>
<p>assiduously, let him console himself with the reflection that the</p>
<p>pains and labours undergone by any man in training for a gymnastic</p>
<p>contest are far larger and more formidable than any which the severest</p>
<p>training of the horseman will involve; and for this reason, that the</p>
<p>greater part of gymnastic exercises are performed “in the sweat of the</p>
<p>brow,” while equestrian exercise is performed with pleasure. Indeed,</p>
<p>there is no accomplishment which so nearly realises the aspiration of</p>
<p>a man to have the wings of a bird than this of horsemanship. But</p>
<p>further, to a victory obtained in war attaches a far greater weight of</p>
<p>glory than belongs to the noblest contest of the arena. Of these</p>
<p>the state indeed will share her meed of glory, but in honour of</p>
<p>victory in war the very gods are wont to crown whole states with</p>
<p>happiness. So that, for my part, I know not if there be aught else</p>
<p>which has a higher claim to be practised than the arts of war.</p>
<p>And this, too, is worth noting: that the buccaneer by sea, the</p>
<p>privateersman, through long practice in endurance, is able to live at</p>
<p>the expense of far superior powers. Yes, and the life of the</p>
<p>freebooter is no less natural and appropriate to landsmen–I do not</p>
<p>say, to those who can till and gather in the fruit of their fields,</p>
<p>but to those who find themselves deprived of sustenance; since there</p>
<p>is no alternative–either men must till their fields or live on the</p>
<p>tillage of others, otherwise how will they find the means either of</p>
<p>living or of obtaining peace?</p>
<p>Here, too, is a maxim to engrave upon the memory: in charging a</p>
<p>superior force, never to leave a difficult tract of ground in the rear</p>
<p>of your attack, since there is all the difference in the world between</p>
<p>a stumble in flight and a stumble in pursuit.</p>
<p>There is another precaution which I feel called upon to note. Some</p>
<p>generals, in attacking a force which they imagine to be inferior</p>
<p>to their own, will advance with a ridiculously insufficient force,</p>
<p>so that it is the merest accident if they do not experience the injury</p>
<p>they were minded to inflict. Conversely, in attacking any enemy whose</p>
<p>superiority is a well-known fact, they will bring the whole of their</p>
<p>force into action.</p>
<p>Now, my maxim would be precisely converse: if you attack with a</p>
<p>prospect of superiority, do not grudge employing all the power at your</p>
<p>command; excess of victory never yet caused any conqueror one pang</p>
<p>of remorse.</p>
<p>But in any attempt to attack superior forces, in full certainty that,</p>
<p>do what you can, you must eventually retire, it is far better, say I,</p>
<p>under these circumstances to bring a fraction only of your whole force</p>
<p>into action, which fraction should be the pick and flower of the</p>
<p>troops at your command, both horses and men. A body of that size and</p>
<p>quality will be able to strike a blow and to fall back with greater</p>
<p>security. Whereas, if a general brings all his troops into action</p>
<p>against a superior force, when he wishes to retire, certain things</p>
<p>must happen: those of his men who are worse mounted will be captured,</p>
<p>others through lack of skill in horsemanship will be thrown, and a</p>
<p>third set be cut off owing to mere difficulties of ground; since it is</p>
<p>impossible to find any large tract of country exactly what you would</p>
<p>desire. If for no other reason, through sheer stress of numbers there</p>
<p>will be collisions, and much damage done by kicks through mutual</p>
<p>entanglement; whereas a pick of horse and men will be able to escape</p>
<p>offhand, especially if you have invention to create a scare in the</p>
<p>minds of the pursuers by help of the moiety of troops who are out of</p>
<p>action. For this purpose false ambuscades will be of use.</p>
<p>Another serviceable expedient will be to discover on which side a</p>
<p>friendly force may suddenly appear and without risk to itself put a</p>
<p>drag on the wheels of the pursuer. Nay, it is self-evident, I think,</p>
<p>that, as far as work and speed are concerned, it is the small body</p>
<p>which will assert its superiority more rapidly over the larger, and</p>
<p>not vice versa–not of course that the mere fact of being a small body</p>
<p>will enable them to endure toil or give them wings; but simply it is</p>
<p>easier to find five men than five hundred, who will take the requisite</p>
<p>care and pains with their horses, and personally practise of their own</p>
<p>accord the art of horsemanship.</p>
<p>But suppose the chance should occur of entering the lists against an</p>
<p>equal number of the enemy’s cavalry, according to my judgment it were</p>
<p>no bad plan to split the squadron into divisions, the first of</p>
<p>which should be commanded by the squadron-leader, and the other by the</p>
<p>ablest officer to be found. This second-officer will for the time</p>
<p>being follow in rear of the leading division with the squadron leader;</p>
<p>and by and by, when the antagonist is in near proximity, and when the</p>
<p>word of command is passed, form squadron to the front and charge the</p>
<p>hostile ranks–a manouvre calculated, as I conceive, to bring the</p>
<p>whole mass down upon the enemy with paralysing force, and to cause him</p>
<p>some trouble to extricate himself. Ideally speaking, both</p>
<p>divisions will be backed by infantry kept in rear of the cavalry;</p>
<p>these will suddenly disclose themselves, and rushing to close</p>
<p>quarters, in all probability clench the nail of victory. So at any</p>
<p>rate it strikes me, seeing as I do the effects of what is unexpected–</p>
<p>how, in the case of good things, the soul of man is filled to</p>
<p>overflowing with joy, and again, in the case of things terrible,</p>
<p>paralysed with amazement. In proof of what I say, let any one reflect</p>
<p>on the stupor into which a body of men with all the weight of</p>
<p>numerical advantage on their side will be betrayed by falling into an</p>
<p>ambuscade; or again, on the exaggerated terror mutually inspired in</p>
<p>belligerents during the first few days, of finding themselves posted</p>
<p>in face of one another.</p>
<p>To make these dispositions is not hard; the difficulty is to discover</p>
<p>a body of men who will dash forward and charge an enemy as above</p>
<p>described intelligently and loyally, with an eager spirit and</p>
<p>unfailing courage. That is a problem for a good cavalry general to</p>
<p>solve. I mean an officer who must be competent to so assert himself in</p>
<p>speech or action that those under him will no longer hesitate.</p>
<p>They will recognise of themselves that it is a good thing and a right</p>
<p>to obey, to follow their leader, to rush to close quarters with</p>
<p>the foe. A desire will consume them to achieve some deed of glory and</p>
<p>renown. A capacity will be given them patiently to abide by the</p>
<p>resolution of their souls.</p>
<p>Their’s not to make reply,</p>
<p>Their’s not to reason why,</p>
<p>Their’s but to do and die.</p>
<p>To turn to another matter, take the case in which you have two armeis</p>
<p>facing one another in battle order, or a pair of fortresses</p>
<p>belonging to rival powers, and in the space between all kinds of</p>
<p>cavalry manouvres are enacted, wheelings and charges and retreats.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances the custom usually is for either party after</p>
<p>wheeling to set off at a slow pace and to gallop full speed only in</p>
<p>the middle of the course. But now suppose that a commander, after</p>
<p>making feint in this style, presently on wheeling quickens for the</p>
<p>charge and quickens to retire–he will be able to hit the enemy far</p>
<p>harder, and pull through absolutely without scathe himself most</p>
<p>likely; through charging at full speed whilst in proximity to his own</p>
<p>stronghold (or main body), and quickening to a gallop as he retires</p>
<p>from the stronghold (or main body) of the enemy. If further, he could</p>
<p>secretly contrive to leave behind four or five troopers, the bravest</p>
<p>and best mounted of the squadron, it would give them an immense</p>
<p>advantage in falling upon the enemy whilst wheeling to return to the</p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p>IX To read these observations over a few times will be sufficient, but</p>
<p>for giving them effect the officer will need perpetually to act as</p>
<p>circumstances require. He must take in the situation at a glance,</p>
<p>and carry out unflinchingly whatever is expedient for the moment. To</p>
<p>set down in writing everything that he must do, is not a whit more</p>
<p>possible than to know the future as a whole. But of all hints and</p>
<p>suggestions the most important to my mind is this: whatever you</p>
<p>determine to be right, with diligence endeavour to perform. For be it</p>
<p>tillage of the soil, or trading, or seafaring, or the art of ruling,</p>
<p>without pains applied to bring the matter to perfection, the best</p>
<p>theories in the world, the most correct conclusions, will be</p>
<p>fruitless.</p>
<p>One thing I am prepared to insist on: it is clear to myself that by</p>
<p>Heaven’s help our total cavalry force might be much more quickly</p>
<p>raised to the full quota of a thousand troopers, and with far less</p>
<p>friction to the mass of citizens, by the enrolment of two hundred</p>
<p>foreign cavalry. Their acquisition will be doubly helpful, as</p>
<p>intensifying the loyalty of the entire force and as kindling a mutual</p>
<p>ambition to excel in manly virtue.</p>
<p>I can state on my own knowledge that the Lacedaemonian cavalry only</p>
<p>began to be famous with the introduction of foreign troopers; and</p>
<p>in the other states of Hellas everywhere the foreign brigades stand in</p>
<p>high esteem, as I perceive. Need, in fact, contributes greatly to</p>
<p>enthusiasm. Towards the necessary cost of the horses I hold that an</p>
<p>ample fund will be provided, partly out of the pockets of those who</p>
<p>are only too glad to escape cavalry service (in other words, those on</p>
<p>whom the service devolves prefer to pay a sum of money down and be</p>
<p>quit of the duty), and from wealthy men who are physically</p>
<p>incompetent; and I do not see why orphans possessed of large estates</p>
<p>should not contribute. Another belief I hold is that amongst our</p>
<p>resident aliens there are some who will show a laudable ambition if</p>
<p>incorporated with the cavalry. I argue from the fact, apparent to</p>
<p>myself, that amongst this class persons are to be found most zealously</p>
<p>disposed to carry out the part assigned to them, in every other branch</p>
<p>of honourable service which the citizens may choose to share with</p>
<p>them. Again, it strikes me that if you seek for an energetic infantry</p>
<p>to support your cavalry, you will find it in a corps composed of</p>
<p>individuals whose hatred to the foe is naturally intense. But the</p>
<p>success of the above suggestions will depend doubtless on the</p>
<p>consenting will of Heaven.</p>
<p>And now if the repetition of the phrase throughout this treatise “act</p>
<p>with God,” surprises any one, he may take my word for it that with the</p>
<p>daily or hourly occurrence of perils which must betide him, his</p>
<p>wonderment will diminish; as also with the clearer recognition of the</p>
<p>fact that in time of war the antagonists are full of designs against</p>
<p>each other, but the precise issue of these plots and counterplots is</p>
<p>rarely known. To what counsellor, then, can a man apply for advice in</p>
<p>his extremity save only to the gods, who know all things and forewarn</p>
<p>whomsoever they will by victims or by omens, by voice or vision? Is it</p>
<p>not rational to suppose that they will prefer to help in their need,</p>
<p>not those who only seek them in time of momentary stress and trouble,</p>
<p>but those rather who in the halcyon days of their prosperity make a</p>
<p>practice of rendering to Heaven the service of heart and soul?</p>
