                <p class="lead">The underground techno scene is constantly evolving, driven by artists who refuse to compromise their vision for commercial success. Today, I'm sitting down with three producers who represent the cutting edge of this movement: Sarah Vex from Berlin, Marco Luna from Barcelona, and Yuki Tanaka from Tokyo.</p>

                <p>What started as separate conversations in green rooms and after-parties across Europe has evolved into this collaborative interview. These three artists have never met in person, but their music speaks the same language – raw, uncompromising, and deeply rooted in underground culture.</p>

                                <p>For me, it was about finding a space where experimentation was not just accepted but encouraged. I grew up on industrial and noise music, and when I discovered the Berlin techno scene, I realized there was a place where those influences could exist on the dancefloor.</p>
                                <p>The underground isn't just about music – it's about community, about rejecting the mainstream's obsession with accessibility and polish. Raw is beautiful.</p>

                                <p>I came from a jazz background, believe it or not. What attracted me to underground techno was the emphasis on improvisation and the spiritual aspect of extended DJ sets. In Barcelona's after-hours scene, I found DJs playing 8, 10, even 12-hour sets – that's not just DJing, that's storytelling.</p>

                                <p>In Tokyo, the underground is quite different from Europe. There's less emphasis on the "dark" aesthetic and more on texture and atmosphere. I was drawn to artists like Donato Dozzy and Voices from the Lake who proved techno could be meditative and psychedelic, not just aggressive.</p>

                                <p>That's the eternal question, isn't it? I think the key is not chasing the audience – let them find you. I've turned down remix opportunities and label deals that would have given me more exposure because they wanted me to "make it more accessible." That's code for "water it down."</p>

                                <p>I don't see it as a tension at all. My audience will always be niche, and I'm completely fine with that. I'd rather play to 200 people who truly understand what I'm doing than 2,000 people who are just there for the Instagram moment.</p>
                                <p>The underground survives because we refuse to compromise. The moment you start thinking about "reaching a wider audience," you've already lost what made your sound special.</p>

                                <p>I have a slightly different perspective. I think you can grow your audience without compromising, but it requires patience. My Bandcamp following has grown steadily over five years, not through promotion or marketing, but through consistent output and word of mouth.</p>
                                <p>The algorithm-driven world tries to tell us we need to be everywhere all the time. We don't. Quality over quantity applies to audience building too.</p>

                                <p>I'm very much a "vibe" producer. I never sit down with a plan. I usually start with field recordings or found sounds – last week I recorded the sounds of the Tokyo subway at 2 AM and built an entire track around that texture.</p>
                                <p>My studio is minimal: a laptop, one synth (currently a Make Noise 0-Coast), and a handful of effects pedals. Limitations breed creativity.</p>

                                <p>I'm the opposite – I'm all hardware, all the time. Modular synths, drum machines, effects units. No computer except for recording the final mix. This approach forces me to commit to decisions in real-time, which I think gives my music a more organic feel.</p>
                                <p>My process is almost like a live performance. I'll jam for an hour, record everything, then go back and find the moments that worked.</p>

                                <p>I usually start with the groove – get the kick and bass locked in perfectly, then build everything around that foundation.</p>

                                <p>It was devastating at first. I make music for clubs, and suddenly there were no clubs. But it forced me to think differently about my sound. I started making tracks that worked in headphones, not just on a massive sound system.</p>
                                <p>That exploration led to my "Lockdown Sessions" EP, which is some of my favorite work. Silver linings, I guess.</p>

                                <p>Honestly, it made me more militant about the importance of underground spaces. Seeing how quickly governments shut down clubs while leaving other businesses open made it clear – we're not valued. We're seen as dispensable.</p>

                                <p>I think we're going to see a split. On one hand, the "underground" aesthetic will continue to be commodified and watered down for festivals. On the other hand, there will always be true underground spaces and artists who reject that commercialization.</p>

Despite being separated by thousands of miles and coming from different musical backgrounds, these three artists share a common thread: an uncompromising dedication to their craft and a refusal to let commercial pressures dictate their creative direction.</p>
                    
                    <p>The underground isn't a place or even a sound – it's a mindset. It's about valuing authenticity over popularity, community over clout, and artistry over algorithm.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thanks to Sarah, Marco, and Yuki for taking the time to share their perspectives. Follow them, support them, and most importantly – go see them play if they come to your city.</p>
