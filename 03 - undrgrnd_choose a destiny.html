                <p>it's very obvious that the secondary father, the one that feels deep envy about your true mother is a bit of a weak bastard who also happens to be a coward is very envious of why your mother looks cool while also serious but he still a fucking loser after 40 years of no style clearly defined, what an idiot, hwat your mother does in 4 hours of mirror daily he can't after 37 years of trying stupid shit, pathetic.</p>

                <p>why is he such an obstacle? you might ask, well it's because this is your big hit bro, and he, not only still looks loser and loses hair eery day because of failure, he's never been given such an opportunity and he probably never will it's obvious why he's yelling at someone who wanna hire you to plan world domination strategies in bdsm uniform for serving milk right?</p>


                <h2>The Gym is not the solution, it is the problem in fact (part 2)</h2>
		<h3>Rethinking Fitness: Why Gyms Fall Short for True Transformation</h3>
                <blockquote>
		<p>trust me doll, ¿you wanna gal party? never, ever go to a gym it will exhaust you forever</p>
                </blockquote>

		
<p>
In a world obsessed with physical aesthetics, many chase six-pack abs and bulging biceps through endless gym sessions. But what if the real path to profound change lies not in weights and machines, but in the ancient wisdom of Kundalini yoga and meditation? Drawing from yogic science, this post explores why gyms often prove useless for achieving deep personal mastery, while highlighting the risks they pose and the unparalleled benefits of mind training through Kundalini practices. If you're after superficial gains, gyms work fine—but for lasting growth, look inward.
</p>

<h3>What It Will Do for You</h3>

<p>
This meditation totally recharges you.
It is an antidote to depression. It builds a new system, gives you the capacity and caliber to deal with life, and gives you a direct relationship with your pranic body.
</p>

<h3>How to Do It</h3>
<p>Sit with a straight spine in easy pose. Arms are extended straight out in front of you, parallel to the ground. Close your right hand into a fist. Wrap your left fingers around it. The bases of the palms touch. The thumbs are close together and are pulled straight up. The eyes are focused on the thumbs.</p>

<p>Now inhale for 5 seconds (do not hold the breath in); exhale for 5 seconds; hold the breath out for 15 seconds. Continue.</p>

<p>Start with 3 - 5 minutes and work up to 11 minutes. Build up the time slowly.
In time, you can work up to holding the breath out for 1 full minute.</p>

<div>

<h3>The Limits of Gym Culture for Real Change</h3>

<p>
Yogic traditions outline precise timelines for meditation's transformative power, far beyond what physical workouts can deliver. For instance, just 40 days of consistent Kundalini meditation can embody new experiences and heightened capacities, rewiring your energy for clarity and resilience. Extend it to 90 days, and you clear subconscious blocks, forging habits that stick. At 120 days, awareness integrates into daily life, turning challenges into opportunities. And after 1,000 days? You reach self-mastery, a stable consciousness that radiates nobility and grace to all around you—symbolized in numerology as the "1" of individuality amplified by the supportive zeros of body, mind, and spirit.
</p>

<p>
Gyms, by contrast, target only the physical shell. They build muscle and endurance, sure, but they ignore the electromagnetic field, glandular system, and neural pathways that yogic science says shift with even short meditations—like 3 minutes to stabilize blood flow or 11 minutes to recalibrate nerves. If your goal mirrors these yogic outcomes—embodied strength, subconscious healing, or impersonal mastery—pumping iron feels like polishing a car while the engine rusts. Gyms excel at "empty purposes," like fitting into a smaller jeans size or impressing at a beach party, but they can't touch the holistic evolution Kundalini offers.
</p>

<h3>Hidden Dangers in the Gym Scene</h3>
<p>
Beyond their superficial focus, gyms carry real risks, especially from the underbelly of performance enhancement. You'll likely encounter folks addicted to anabolics or steroids, chasing unnatural gains that mask deeper insecurities. These substances flood the body with synthetic hormones, leading to liver damage, heart issues, and hormonal crashes that leave users dependent and depleted.
</p>


<p>Worse, the steroid trade thrives as an open market, often controlled by mafia networks who profit from human desperation rather than face outright bans on manufacturing. Cartels produce these drugs cheaply in clandestine labs, distributing them through gym dealers and online forums, turning bodies into battlegrounds for profit. Forbidding production entirely could curb this, but lax enforcement keeps the flow steady, exposing casual gym-goers to aggressive recruiters or contaminated batches. Why risk entanglement in this shadowy ecosystem when true power comes from within?</p>

<h3>The Body's Perils Without Mind Training</h3>
<p>
Neglecting Kundalini yoga starves the mind, inviting imbalances that ripple through the body. Without practices like 31-minute sessions—which harmonize glands, breath, and cells—you miss tuning the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) and 31 tattvas, leaving projections of fear and doubt unchecked. Over time, this manifests as chronic stress, weakened immunity, and emotional volatility, as the subconscious "shadow mind" festers without integration (achieved at 62 minutes). Even 2.5 hours daily reshapes your psyche against the universal magnetic field, anchoring new patterns—but skip it, and you're adrift, body fraying from unhealed mental wounds. </p> 


<p>Kundalini meditation counters this safely, awakening dormant energy from the spine's base to crown, fostering healing without force. It's the gentlest path to growth: no scalpels, no chemicals, just breath and focus to dissolve traumas and amplify vitality.</p>

<h3>Life-Changing Wins from Kundalini Practice</h3>
<p>Countless practitioners report breakthroughs that gyms can't replicate. One example: overcoming anxiety through 90-day habit-building, where daily kriyas (yogic exercises) dissolve panic attacks, replacing them with calm intuition. Another is career pivots after 120 days, as heightened awareness reveals hidden talents, leading to promotions or bold ventures. For self-mastery at 1,000 days, imagine radiating confidence that inspires teams or communities—impersonal yet profoundly personal.</p>

<p>These shifts heal on every level: physically by balancing hormones naturally, mentally by integrating the three minds (negative, positive, neutral), and spiritually by confirming consciousness amid chaos. As the safest way to grow, Kundalini avoids addiction's pitfalls, building esteem from authentic strength. Remember, true self-worth blooms when you honor your inner light—start small, meditate daily, and watch your essence expand. You're already noble; this practice just reveals it.</p>

  <h2>then why would you wanna 'help them'...</h2>
  <p>
    no see, i can do nothing if you wanna consider them part of your family of your purpose, but eventually you're there for pleasure and nothing else, if it was for the money i think i already told you
  </p>

  <blockquote>
        <p>the lack of rigor in education creates lack of rigor in your economy</p>
                </blockquote>
  <h3>Support</h3>
  <p>
    what you need to find ir order for the cash to flow and start motving is your family to support you on a project which has two possible roads
  </p>
  <h3>one</h3>
  <p>
    they support you on your studies of whatever scientific field you wanna explore because they have the money to help you, push you and stand you
  </p>
  <h3>or two</h3>
  <p>
    they support you but they don't have the money so you get certain education benefit that pays the total amount of your career because you are a brainy nerd and the institution can see that, in both cases you need be determined and choose a scientific career regardless of the initial possible outcome, and that's what helps your family, not this bro... 
  </p>
  <h3>Every Big Agency has one</h3>
  <p>
    she will notice that you pretend to have them on your side, probably because you're stressed due to not knowing wether you're gonna be part of this big project, after all is the chance of your big hit and you are supposed to capitalize on it, but don't rush bro i have plenty of room for you and for everyone, you can't believe how big my 'heart' is when im in the office of this project so it's ok bro. but the psychologist will notice it and will try to relax you with a joke or two...
  </p>

  <h3>Straight to the Point but hard to answer</h3>
  <p>good question the answer to that question is always be naughty, but also never be stupid enough to chase, the moment you start to chase you surrender your strength to caprices, and that my dear friend is dangeours</p>
