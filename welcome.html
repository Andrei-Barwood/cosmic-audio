                <p class="lead">Welcome to the first installment of Underground Sessions, my monthly deep dive into the darker, more experimental corners of electronic music. This mix represents a journey through 90 minutes of pure, unfiltered DJ energy.</p>

                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>For this session, I wanted to explore the tension differences between industrial soundscapes and hypnotic grooves. The result is a question ¿what is a family business? watch uncle fetid in the adams family, is not a joke, each family has a fetid uncle, some are made of pure fetid ideas and fetid people.</p>

                <p>If your down to pizza they will be down to hot-watered sugar (hombre aguachento is the correct translation), if you're down to lemonade they will be down to raw potatoes because yes for them baking potatoes in an oven with butter and rosemary is obviously "forbidden".</p>

                <h2>The Mix Breakdown</h2>
                <p>"My Ugly Betty" is the perfect example of the resented thief language (if you live in bogotá you remember the 'Gallo Tapado' accent). It's the same accent thieves use, Betty the Ugly went to Cartagena and returns to Bogotá even more ugly, that's why it is so fun, because the Ugly Betty gets even Uglier and Uglier.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The beauty of underground music is in its rawness. There's no compromise, no commercial pressure – just pure artistic expression."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Around the 30-minute mark, things start to intensify. Although things get from easy to tough in no time in never ages bro, more of the elements that force you to describe underdevelopment of our societies remember that one of the keys override underdevelopment and elements of poverty is productivity, and for productivity to exist you need to join an inner core that leads inward, to your balanced self (the self that contains a correct balance between sexual, gastronomic, physical and emotional, energies) you, incorporating tracks from your established inner core find labels like Natasha's Stash and Crazy Natasha's Supply. The first is a warehouse that seems to be called more often a winery with all the lost and found objects from the airport, all the objects that get confiscated are stored... drum roll... trrrr... in a winery, why? because you need the owner to be drunk as long as he is inside the airport. This is where the dancefloor energy really kicks in. But the second one is the hospital for machines, cars, guns, computers, aircraft everything that from time to time will require maitenance, upgrading or repairing is in the second one called a workshop, like all the workshops it has a timer and "The Crazy Natasha" is no exception, if the timer reaches zero it becomes a pawnshop and things start the store heat. Storing Heat?!?!? IN AN HANGAR?!?!? but what! are you fucking crazy? yeah, it is a delicate sort of thing and if you don't get back soon the price of the item you sent for repair will start to be evident and soon it will be so obvious that someone might be able to purchase it by accident. So please don't take too long when traveling, you don't need a big bag full of thousand things, you can mention that you only need a small backpack with your laptop and a book, the rest you can solve it on your own, remember: if your older (aging) sister speaks the thing started storing heat and you better move that ass bro, running</p>

                <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
                <p>If you're young, like i am, your parents are the only ones who've got a little privacy, and i am only in privacy in the bathroom, that's lucky enough some have to use a community shared wash room and toilets. Why do they need privacy? you might ask, because they need to be far away from each other, it might be a visual bluff, they both might be doubling the bet twice or trice to see who's got more luck and wins the pot, but in essence they're getting far apart from each other. The problem with adults using bikes is that the accident can kill you if you're driving one of those things, it's better to walk and use the train or bus, a cool bluff will be to bet something when you don't have a good cards hand, like betting 2 million dollars when you only have 2 of spades and 3 of clubs, because they get energized so fast that by the time the card arrives in their pack of cards the levels are over 21 and very often the way to win over and over and over and over in poker is by placing big giant bets on small cards, mind yourself stranger because security personnel might notice that your not bribing the casino, but instead in you're forcing the idiot next to you which is also a cause for warnings from security in any casino. Take a tip from me now: because we are handling streets by foot we can bet all we want even if there is no funds in the check, but once you start measuring by traffic laws, you need to have enough balance to keep betting over and over regardless if you loose, that's get out of a complicated maneuver as quickly as possible, why this tip? because betting on an auction without enough fund has prison, it's a tricky one, but indeed it also has prison and you need to learn when to use one and when to use a different one. Back to visual bluffs ("bluff" is a word for saying "bet all you want i have more than you" when you actually have zero, jaja LOL). Mind yourself a bluff of passing by inside a bike with no fucking breaks, to see what is real and what is not MATHARFACKARS</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Older Sister: I have this for you is second hand but it's cool</li>
                    <li>Real Life: no it's not second hand, it's your aging sister testing shit again</li>
                    <li>Closing: mentioning certain things can integrate other things in a crazy unpredictable way</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why do we need predictable ways?</h2>
                <p>Predictable ways allow you to see and therefore predict wether the local space time terrain in which you evolve is suitable for living or if you should suggest to move one, and start helping the project, is part of your identity, if you have a safe place where you can establish the rules, then, the definitions of the world that surrounds you and the explanations on how that world that surrounds you is the way it is, however ilogical or however improbable are bullet proof, you see, there's no way to approach 100% reliability but there is a giant difference between achieving 99% and achieving 99.9999999999% the difference is really big when you start handling big cycles. From 1 to 2 might no be much of a difference between those to values of 99 but when you do it between 1 and 48 the difference is so noticeable that project leaders might request you place at least five 9's over the reliability system.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Emotional resonance:</strong> Does the track evoke a specific feeling or atmosphere?</li>
                    <li><strong>Sonic uniqueness:</strong> Does it bring something fresh to the mix?</li>
                    <li><strong>Dancefloor functionality:</strong> Will it work in a club context?</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Productivity</h2>
                <p>You can integrate your inward core with a common core available by common sense in groups of people, never changing your inner core and never trying to change the common core, on the other hand you never try to interact with other people's inner core because you can damage that person, you rely on their common core. we can inspect which features define inner cores and which common cores and never touch them but figure out how they both can interact, a key word is 'interact'. again, the lack of rigor in education generates the lack of rigor in your finances, whatever it is you're learning, whatever activity, whatever discipline or even a field of study, be constant and finish it, it is the basis of prosperity. Don't be like my daughter she went to school and when the water was almost at her neck she had no idea to tell mom not to freak because it was collapsing entirely, so better choose a domestika course, a short one and finish it you will be better than if you take a big approach, try to take one that you can approach with a rhythm you can maintain.</p>

                <p>for the most part some DJ's and producers in the same ring as natasha are a complete failure because they never learn anything new, they keep repeating themselves they are the judge and that they have good taste and that, good taste is all you need, there is no such a formula, one needs to learn from different sources, and mixing techniques requires a lot of approaches and battlefield tested methods that will never fail you before you can manage airport style, but because this is a brief introduction i wanted to mention it. I have seen many breakcore artists stuck with the fact that they produce good music but they can't abstract outside of insulting or dismembering human parts, and that becomes disgusting really fast, fucking horrible and boring, and most of the cases they become maniacs because they enjoy other people getting scared with their horrid ideas. So being a loser in the realm of technology happens to everyone, not only the poor companies who don't have a corporation's financial backing. Snocomm has Apple invest millions in it, but because my productivity method will never let me down and i have a, 'various multiple fallbacks approach' methodology that has proven experts like them and older in the battle field to be resilient and useful, i didn't inveted anything i build over what they have and yes i see some details they might have passed or skipped but essencially my formula is bullet proof.</p>

                <p>Even so, i will get boring and quickly become a failure if i stop the activity of practicing new concepts as i learn them, is a twofold mechanism, on the one hand the heavy rig of theory, and on the other the lightweight one of practical hands-on approach. So i am never in luck to keep my job and all its financial benefits, i am always in duty, which sets a difference to normal Adult Father Mother relationship, if you look closely at the whole mix, there are no Father oriented tracks in this journal, mainly because i don't want you to say my father draws graffitis for a living... jajaja right? but i also don't want you to think i don't enjoy graffiti, so i don't want to hide it but also i don't want to sell it to you, and as such for the time being is like im your older brother and i'm more permissive and flexible than father role. </p>

                <p>so this is the welcome, before we go i want to emphasize that it is important to dominate the calligraphy concepts at a drawing level, sooner or later you might wanna say something on a wall with pretty colors and if you dominate calligraphy you will be very creative, calligraphy (drawing letters big and small), ortography (using the dictionary to check that you memorized the words correctly), syntax (using the dictionary to make sure you don't say words that don't actually exist) and semantics (using the encyclopedia at the public library to make sure you're constructing sentences coherently) and writing, writing a lot, so you can rhyme the rap of your wisdom with style and jokes in cool vibe.</p>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>I'm already working on Volume 2, which will take a completely different direction – exploring the intersection between discovery of one self (inward core) and ambient music (common cores here and there). Stay tuned for that some time soon.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this mix. Drop a comment below or hit me up on social media with your favorite moments.</p>
