					El último episodio de Mega Doll, ocurre en modo sinfónico, algunas canciones no tienen instrumentos sinfónicos, solo se utilizan con la forma musical del genero sinfonía. Ocurren en distintos momentos de toda la historia, cuando terminé encontré que tienen muchas cosas en común y que ocurrieron de manera espontánea, pero que volviendo a hojear las cosas, vale la pena tenerlos en una colección aparte, organizada

				<p>
					As some circumstances were following each other, i found myself wandering at Soul Angel Valley. I found Yui and her sight was about some complicated procedures, enemies and documentations...<br><br>In Austria, when i was studying composition, my fourth semester professor was Gustav Mahler (Austrian composer), to teach a class about the symphonyc style and how it fits the symphony genre. He explained that he always used the brass section, the trombones, the tubas, the trumpets and french horns to represent a war posture, wether defensive, or territorial or aggressive, he said there's just too many dispositions are tkane into consideration when at arms to protect a personal interest, he also explained that some interest can be material, for example, the wealth of a country can be gold or money, or maybe farms, universities, temples and churches, there were so many examples, and i asked him why the brass. He said it had nothing to do with material things, other than when he was young thinking of his fifth symphony behind his house he will always see the Martial Band in front of the house of his beloved Ana. He said: "You'll feel lost if you have to hold a battle with a pen, a paper and a symphony in mind trying to catch peace of mind to place what you feel while at the same time she is being bombarded with comments and things to make her feel stress. When i had enough time and enough peace of mind, she was sitting next to me and i was writing the second movement of my fifth symphony, which is a love song i always wanted her to enjoy, with a deutsche gramophon and so damn loud. The other students were late that day, he explained the same story to them, except this time he avoided quite clearly the fact that there are other interests besides the material. That was the first day of our spontaneous military academy conversations with him. He never spoke about music again, he was on politics, on how to correct democracy and how to think about the system of a city in terms of a productive logical mechanism that allows art to exist, and what are the purposes of music at that point, which ended up saying that you can isolate forever just to chase music and let the world be destroyed or you rather take action. One day he said, Dimitri Shostakovich was a lawyer, in fact, after years of working as a great lawyer, he decided to write very interesting symphonies, nobody ever valued him as a human being again, he move to the united states as a refugee because his symphonies were marked as against the political interest of the country at that time. Any composer who was ever approached a symphony requires a specific study because there's too much to know. He is one of the best ever, and was not valued as a lawyer anymore because of being a musical genius. If he had been a musician his first 40 years of life, no one will have taken so seriously his notion of justice.<br><br>When i finally met Yui, i was scared of finding her because i was always insecure on what to expect, i remember my first trip outside of planet earth i saw a giant door in Japan, i wanted to always go there and see why all the countries look so tiny, i mean their surface, but th surface of japan looked as if they had a door the size of a building with millions and millions of floors. When i finally finished that trip i went back to the Los Angeles. I decided i will pay the Japanese government a visit to say hi and explain that i was an Astronaut and that i had a picture of this place and that i wanted to know if there is a reference of information i could obtain or if it was forbidden to know any information about it.<br><br>I felt the tension, it was her, it was Yui. A few weeks later fukushima nuclear plant exploded and Japan was at a terrible risk of being devastated forever, today. almost 10 years later i understand that it all was connected. Today i takes a different direction and Mega Doll, was finished when the album "A the Interior of Our Ocean" was released in 2020, i also said that there was a lot of music not being recorded yet, and there are missing parts, but this are the last releases, the number 99, 100, 101, and the 102 releases, out of 104 release in total.<br><br>After such a long run i decided it was enough, i needed to read the story again, look back at 10 years of music, check what it is to be here, and so many new things have come to my ears, but i feel really tired i want to take a break, read the story again and plan were the music is going to be out of so much has happened now i have like 4 months not writing or recording any music, i really need to rest and sleep and im sure i will be back with something new why not. But for the moment i need some silence and sleep<br><br>Thank You
