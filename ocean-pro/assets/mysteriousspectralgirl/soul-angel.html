From that source a white angel becomes a Devilish Black God, finally, his tree, after so many decades, gives his first leafs, and it looks it's ready to flourish, i will never have the fortune to pay for that, i feel there is a process happening here...">

					Physicalism, Ryan&rsquo;s Putter, and Ghosts<br><br>What is physicalism? Physicalism is the view that everything is physical, as opposed to dualism, which is the view that some things are physical and some things are non-physical. This is not an incredibly helpful answer, though, because it doesn&rsquo;t tell us what it takes to be a physical thing and what it takes to be a non-physical thing. We can attribute some properties to physical things, such as being located in space and time, and being able to cause physical events (whatever physical events may be). But this is not enough. Luckily, there are a couple of theories concerning what counts as physical and what doesn&rsquo;t. One theory is that physical things are those that can be completely described by the vocabulary of the best possible theory of physics (presumably this would be a complete physics). Physicalism would thus be the view that this theory of physics would completely specify all the fundamental categories, all the ingredients we need to make the world. Another theory is that the physical properties are the ones needed to account for the objects we accept as physical; for example, Andrew Ryan&rsquo;s putter.1 The physicalist&rsquo;s claim would be that these properties are the only ones we need to account for the rest of the world. So the same basic ingredients we need to make Ryan&rsquo;s putter (the physical properties) can be used to account for weird stuff like Plasmids and ghosts.<br><br>If we go for the first option and hold that physical properties are the ones that a complete theory of physics would specify, then one issue we would have to deal with is that the BioShock world may have a different complete theory of physics. Objects move around differently in the game than they would in the actual world (because of the physics engine and whatnot). So we would have to heavily revise our theories of physics in order to account for a world that works the same way as a game&rsquo;s physics engine. If this is so, then we may not be able to identify the physical properties with the properties that the best possible theory of physics mentions. The best theory of physics would differ between our world and the BioShock world. So there wouldn&rsquo;t be one class of “physical” properties that the physicalist would say existed.<br><br>This is not quite right, however. In worlds with physics much like the BioShock world&rsquo;s physics we could still tell the difference between the physical things and the non-physical things. The physical things would just be the things mentioned by the best possible theory of physics in that world. What counts as physical may differ from world to world, but there are some things that we would not consider physical in any situation. Beings made out of ectoplasm (if you haven&rsquo;t seen Ghostbusters, it might still be on Netflix, depending when you&rsquo;re reading this) and angels would be excluded from a mature theory of physics<br><br>The second option—where the basic ingredients needed to account for obviously physical objects can be used to account for ghosts and weird stuff—may not be the best for our purposes. The ghosts, the Plasmids, and the Little Sisters in Rapture may be made out of completely different ingredients to the things in the actual world. Perhaps ADAM could not be realized with the kind of stuff (chemicals and so on) we have in the actual world, and so then the stuff in Rapture would be radically unlike the stuff we have here.<br><br>•&nbsp;Soy La Mascota de El Señor Burbrujitas<br>• Susurros de Muñeca<br><br>the following are the unfinished tracks, they are not inside the music, this is just for the record<br><br><br><br>1 - Soy La Mascota de El Señor Burbrujitas<br>2 - Los Susurros de una Muñeca<br>3 - tiempo para sentir el sol<br>4 - el sabor de la telekinesis femenina<br>5 - manos de fuego<br>6 - teletransportarse a traves del amor, irradiar uso<br>7 - esencia<br>8 - poseer<br>9 - percepción extrasensorial<br>10 - merlot<br>11 - la galaxia del dolor<br>
