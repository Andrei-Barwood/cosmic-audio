					Laura and Liliana:<br>It took me to seconds to realize the 3 of them, i never thought i really know the beginning of this story by simply including myself, so there was always only two mirrors, this two mirrors became the source for sacred tradition and changed the importance of modern spirituality. The techniques of the Ancient Cosmogony, beliefs of the laws of nature as quantum physics, calculus and algebra and other spiritual beings. Sacred Science and its component disciplines: esoteric architecture, cosmic resonance, and possible theorizations. An ancient temple at the bottom of the ocean with two tombs, and two supposedly death bodies, they looked so young... and full of life, it seemed they were on an eternal sleep with no aging, Laura and Liliana rest in peace forever in this ancient temple, to get there i needed a sense of cosmic orientation, symbols to represents circumstances and equations that furnished, the fact that no one will ever be able to find them but it also required the artist touch, that finesse and delicate precision it requires to approach the spiritual constituion of that temple through ritual. There is no simple way to get there, manipulate the cardinal quarters, and i had to invoke forces of the two elements, the cosmos and all its possible planet formations outside of the heavens on earth as much as all that apply over the surface of the earth. It was quite the journey. This delineation of the Lunar, Solar, and Stellar calendars suggested either that they both were death forever or that, if i was to get to them i was about to be near my last breath. It all came down to Cosmis Resonance, at least to me. But Laura was stock at Cosmic Tides coming from everywhere and Liliana was so asleep... I remember the light body and i thought i was ready to get to discover them. But i found there was three shadows waiting for me to get killed if i were to make any false step... i was not careful enough, perhaps i was young, i ignored the rules my enemy uses to fight, i ignored he killed my trainer who was an old version of myself. I ignored that and so much more. Instead of me getting killed i was now present, but Laura was now absent. Somehow i woke up to a place in which we are family, Laura died the thursday and at friday during the Divination process that takes place when something like that happens, i was trying to read the tarot in front of everyone to start healing, to find out where to match paths with her, for protection and eventually bringing her back. Two days later Liliana started sleeping forever. I was so confused by the Creation Cycle and all its rules. Have the Cosmic Powers vanished their Solar Wings? what about the Elevation of the Temple??, what about invoking &nbsp;the spirits of the elements of nature, what has it all to do with two sacred tombs at the bottom of the ocean just two days before that Thursday, what about the island that is impossible to reach... what about that? i came to beach and walking showering my feet with wet sand i disocovered the water was too transparent almos tilogically transparent, by watching directly to it for a second that, the depth of this ocean was strange, you could wal for one meter, but then when i tried to keep walking the transparent water revealed the depth as if it was the top of a mountain in the sky, it is impossible to walk from the sands to the rest of the water without falling forever, i will never understand why it is not a safe small not so deep ocean driving me toward that island... i had to spin my head thousand times to decide wether or not i was going to accept the fact that the only way to get there was to walk through a dark cave full of death monsters trying to regain some vitality, through dark passages that seem to lead any where but never at all, to that island where she was beautiful, perfect, safe... it was impossible, eventually i got to this island and found messages written in the sand, messages that i wish i'd never found...<br><br>•&nbsp;Shadows In The Faces That Live In The Woods<br>•&nbsp;Slightly Drown<br>•&nbsp;Saw Masha Today<br>•&nbsp;Underwater Voice<br>•&nbsp;Long Youth Aftermath<br>•&nbsp;The Heart Of It All<br>•&nbsp;Injured<br>•&nbsp;Love that Whiskey Mist Hangover, Over and Over<br>•&nbsp;Green Tea With Vanessa
