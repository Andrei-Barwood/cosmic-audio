					as the process started i could sense she was investing a fortune, it feels a bit like a lemon pie, not in the sense of a cream pie right?, more like, its tasty, creamy, acid and somewhat like the inverse of an energy drink? well something like that. She is converting blood into milk to give me a chance to form my bones. There is a price to pay for all that, but i will never get near that, because there's this forest that contains some absurd circumstances, as much as pure abstracts of the pure darkness of a pure night, happenning uncomfortably. Sexual instincts assume that you have like this perfect peace to wild, and the will to wild free of any physical weakness, or mental weakness, so much tension so much stress, but how can we assume the same, how can asumme this pre asumption that we will fit in no matter what. All things come from the ocean all things go to the ocean. She is mine, she is the small size i adore, with her authentic version of beauty, she is the first ocean that ever existed. She is the ultimate truth. So many truths trying to take away all their fears... Dishonored, Tarnished, Stranded... Island and the ocean is furious, bad weather... is not a good night to sail but tomorrow the sun won't rise, and for a few weeks it will not shine at all, this ship is just too weak and i'm still to low level to fight this kind but mortal enemy. Waiting... why am i waiting, what is it that i obtain from all this, i can't think of any question or any answer. my destiny is on earth, after the borders with Green Land (Groenland), so many countries, once in Green Land i will find a bridge to the canadian forest it's a matter of time, this place is giant, and cold as matharfucker, bad weather. I'm not here to complain, im not a human being to have an spiritual experience, im thankful for my beautiful daughter, my beautiful wife, the irish girl who never loses a battle with me, instead she enjoys fighting and winning against me... she smiles when i start fights... i have nothing to complain, this god damn weather makes me feel stranded when i have not even set sail, bad weather... how long does it take from here to there, this god damn maps shows it so fckn far away, i hopes is not too much.<br>She turned me into a spiritual being to have a human element experience, i can only think of the horizon shining, no longer infinite ice mountains, no longer infinite polar deserts, no longer this freezing effect, just their forest, and ready to find someone to tell where to find them. I can only imagine shining crystals, sometimes i imagine places with giant rugs wet with wine sleeping in front of giant windows. I sometimes imagine a french girl named babsie, drinking french wine, playing the game of kiss me the french thing and i kiss her french thing as we rest on the stairs, without here i can burn into ashes, the harp suggests patience, but this goddamn storm is driving me crazy.<br>The harp suggest the Grand Finale, i still don't see where this Grand Finale occurs. But i assume is gonna be a good surprise, it's the moment of my life, the moment i will be there for.<br><br>• Tiramisú Limón<br>•&nbsp;Bosque Nocturno<br>•&nbsp;Instintos Sexuales<br>•&nbsp;Divina, Mia, Hermosa, Pequeña (Divi-Nation)<br>•&nbsp;Brillo De La Extrema Perfección Cristálea<br>•&nbsp;Vitralica: Charcos de Whiskey En Las Escaleras<br>•&nbsp;Grand Finale
