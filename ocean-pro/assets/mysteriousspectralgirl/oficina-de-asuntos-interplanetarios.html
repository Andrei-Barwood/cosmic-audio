					This is a Four Phases piece for choir and woodwind with orchestra and breakcore as the argument. I finally come to realize everything mixed in a consistent rather inconsistent way i will not explain because i knew i will not understand so i didn't bothered, i sorted back a few times to Egypt to train and meditate a bit, to walk and as much as i'd look like a wanderer i was organizing everything, i was fixing it all, just i it didn't much sense while at figuring out, so everytime someone asked me where this was going i will always answer this will end with a good shower, and kept walking trying to understand things, i remember so many wise words that i want to share here, wise words from my days in absolute isolation in the desert training to become the strongest martial artist in this universe and however many galactic regions ever to come:<br><br>In the Egyptian universe, the cosmogenesis was not defined by one episode.<br>Rather, it was seen as a cyclic process in rhythmic phases, where four dimensions exist, interpenetrate, and interact through time and space<br><br>In the first phase, the world of Manu ("horizon of waters") comes into being as the macrocosm or celestial sphere, from which the elements of creation emerge. Its image is a watery mass of undefined powers, where all possibilities are arti-cu­lated, but not manifest.<br>In the second phase, the world of Aakhut ('luminous horizon") appears, in the fiery form of light that illuminates the primeval waters and impels patterns or forms to come into being.<br>In the third phase, the world of Rostau ('horizon of spirits") comes into being, symbolized as a mound upon which the forces of the upper worlds come to rest. This phase expresses the containment of the sacred fire in matter, the genesis of material life in microcosmic form.<br>The last phase of creation, the world of Ament ("horizon of the west") repre­sents the phenomenal world that we experience, where cyclic forces govern the conditions of existence, birth and death. Here, the return to the upper worlds becomes possible, as this realm expresses the fulfillment of the creative forces as well as their predestination for cyclic renewal. This world also possesses the mechanisms for the mutation of the physical form, which make possible the con­scious experience of moving through several phases of existence.<br><br>I found myself as another one in the list, waiting my turn to be granted passage to earth, i then realized that when i was at the interior of our ocean i swimmed out of the water into a polar desert, as i started sort of levitating i thought maybe this is death, i realized i was only walking through the death valley, it is a long line of man, all of them with their hands tied, a black shadow covered their body and their faces expressed terrible deception, they were so deceived of what they trust to be their destiny, and they knew it will drive them to infinity being dead, as i moved on the line i sort of woke up, and found myself walking, with my hands tied part of the black shadow over the entire line of man walking, but there was a blue neon light over my entire silouette and i had the armor of the swan, all the metalic pieces that protected my body in the last fight before i died were intact, all the other men were naked and weak, i was looking real strong and giant, they were all bound to their complacency of the mistake they made, i was not.<br><br>Because i was prooud of my last fight, i might have died but i didn't lost the fight next time i will give everything into the same battle i won't care, it is said that all this men walk through the valley of the death in one line, organized no one dares to get out of that line, because it is supposed to be someone at the end granting acces to different areas, it feels strange to be the shining one, it doesn't change anything, it only means i lost a fight and i didn't died, wherever i happen to be<br><br>I can hear the voice of shunrey praying asking to not open my eyes, to avoid it completely, and the one version of Andrew who was always blind had now his eyes open and it is a terrible place, the line is long i hope there is another chance <br><br>im patient each step takes me closer, even if have to walk to tah planet im in no hurry, its gonna happen, i don't know when, why, how but i am certain it's gonna happen<br><br>• Oceano de Sangre<br>•&nbsp;La Silueta Femenina y Documentos Oficiales<br>•&nbsp;Lago Cristales<br><br>the following are the unfinished tracks, they are not inside the music, this is just for the record<br><br>1 - sangre azul<br>2 - her body affairs and documents<br>4 - lago cristal<br>5 - la infección facial del enemigo<br>6 - pools of blood as rose petals<br>7 - world war doll toys set<br>8 - un angel<br>9 - alas angelicales<br>10 - la voz al interior de una muñeca<br>11 - psicosis cutanea<br>12 - sugar mom<br>13 - crisis emocional de consciencia causada por la ausencia de voz<br>14 - pirotecnia humana<br>15 - tejidos y cristales<br>16 - Capricho de Mujer<br>17 - my blue ocean<br>18 - caminar a traves del fuego<br>19 - in loving memory of a dead teddy bear<br>20 - prisión humana<br>21 - celdas y téjido humano, rosa y petalos<br>22 - pure de manzanas flores y muñecas<br>23 - muñeca, arma de guerra<br>24 - pequeña mascota, disfraz de muñeca<br>25 - Jugar Con El Señor Diario, Jugar a prometernos alegrias<br>
