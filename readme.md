# Mega Doll Music #

This is the mega doll website repository

### multiple applications are constantly updated behind the cameras of the mega doll music website ###

* Apps
* Blog
* Discography

### are the megadollmusic and megadoll sites apps? ###

# YES #

* rendered on a web browser
* Published with output to the Internet and other Network Interfaces with System Administration Authority
* Objective-C
* Swift 5.1.3

# #

the idea behind this repository is to publish the discography and use as much legal resources to get rid of the Sonico Software Interface. 
Because it is full of people involved with tax evasion, when i started developing this app i allowed the system resources to charge all my
accounts for all the online taxes without relying on viruses. My question is why Bill Gates is having so much trouble getting his viruses online.

Norton is not a responsible Company for handling taxes. So, my lawyers and i decided this because then system resources can report how much of their
hardware i am utilizing to maintain a giant app on your web browser with my profile which is the Level of System Administrator. not all websites
require System Administrators. The System Administrators allows me to create magical content optimizing the hardware but it requires electricity bills, 
and other system resources. so here you can check how much system resources does my app use, and it can be as much transparent as possible

#### That said i want you to stop relying on Sonico's record label Techsound, because they don't use cyber security policies to protect your web browsing experience by forcing web interfaces to honor the requests you generate as you click on my website. 

#### It is complex how much a website reacts as people fucks around with their decisions, regardless of how much you fuck around, you have the right to have a secured and protected experience
#### i use the most strict framework for securing and protecting random users on my website, which is called Objective-C, some people don't use it because it is difficult to implement on a website, built on top of C and C++, with that many millions of tools i can guarantee your adventures without any risks ###
#### i use the most flexible multimedia adventures framework, it is called Swift, with the version 5.1.3


i am a DevOps certified engineer since year 2013

money usage on my website is forbidden, and as a personal note, it is dangerous. Go to the website of your bank, 
if it is a "National Bank Institution" but has no website be careful, find a bank that can guarantee the security of your assets offline as much
as online.

for real, im not gonna accept the management of money on my apps and website period, don't insist 

##### now, don't send push requests on Ruby, on Scala, on Scheme or any programming language that is not either Objective-C or Swift, to me is dangerous and these are programming languages that can never guarantee any digital rights in front of any cyber crime instance #####

## i have tutorials on technology, i know what the dangers are ##
