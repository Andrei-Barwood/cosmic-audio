                <h2>thinking you got what it takes?</h2>
                <p>heya! is usual to get this excited for something new? what if its 8+ you might be up for the challenge right?, i am of the theory that states that
		everything happens after eleven am, earlier there's not too much to see, because every store and door in the city is closed, fun begins at 11 am and its 
over at 2 or 3 am, th rest of the time is for sleeping</p>

                <p>Attractive people have everything to do with the tractum, it isn't about anything else, your digestive tractum, if you stimulate it brutally then yes,
		it sure will make you look pretty, i have a few excercises that you can practice to make your face look prettier than ever forever, but you have to practice 
		the exercise daily to be able to see the effects in 2 years, although it takes two years you might feel like the pretiest fruit in this party right away 
		after you finish, it's a breathing technique that focuses on stimulating your heart by channeling energy and air in the same direction, the idea is that you 
		obtain force from your hair, what?!? yes, is the total opposite of the gym</p>


                <h2>The Gym is not the solution, it is the problem in fact</h2>
		<p>
		the logic in the gym is to tell you to use brute force for everything which is very stupid, because if you come being weak to the gym, how the fuck is you 
		supposed to keep up for two years? very idiot proof question and the answer is as logical, NO YOU CAN'T!
		</p>
                <blockquote>
		<p>trust me doll, ¿you wanna gal party? never, ever go to a gym it will exhaust you forever</p>
                </blockquote>

		
<p>
The point is that for your body to grow it's strength you need to separate it twice, one for both mental and spirit, and another for both physical and hair, as usual you should
never touch your hair. But and im gonna be painful with this one, gym is dangerous and exhausting because it rquires you to firmly hold metallic materials, that implies the 
fact of closing the hands, once you close the hands you close everything, and no strength can flow inward nor outward, what stupid routine i never grow, i block the energy
and with calculus in the mind. Sometimes the calculus goe to the kidneys and men end up tired of the kidneys, JAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAJAJAJAJA THEY ARE A FUNNY JOKE
</p>

<p>
the point is that in order for you to close your hands to block and etc etc, you have to push hard and pull hard, instead if you don't, and do it carefully, softly, without 
closing the hands, carrying the weight of your own body, rather than the weight of something dead. And that goes for everything, for eating, for drinking dead things, carrying 
dead things, or carrying the water of other things, like vegetables, your brain will be exalted once you start drinking the water of the vegetables you consume, back to our 
point, you need to love yourself, and care for yourself, not a metallic bar dude... what the fuck?! in any case once you tsart realizing the weight of your body is more 
important, lets figure this out the following way:

</p>

<div>
<p>
Imagine your body is like a mini-universe, a sparkling galaxy inside you full of invisible energy waves that connect everything, just like the stars and planets in the real 
cosmos. In electrical engineering, we know these waves are like electric currents flowing in circuits, pulsing up and down in smooth curves called sine waves—think of 
trigonometry as the math that draws those perfect, wavy lines, like the orbits of planets or the ripples in a cosmic pond. This yoga exercise is like tuning your inner galaxy's 
power grid to make your heart's energy field stronger and brighter, so you feel calm, glowing, and full of life.
</p>

<p>
To do it, sit comfortably on your heels, like you're perched on a cozy throne in space, with your arms stretched out straight to the sides, parallel to the ground, and your 
hands dangling loose from the wrists, like floppy starfish floating in zero gravity. Now, start "Breath of Fire"—that's a quick, powerful breathing trick where you puff air in 
and out through your nose like a little engine chugging along, fast and rhythmic for 3 minutes. It feels like revving up the waves in your body's electromagnetic field, those 
sine-wave patterns from trig that help energy flow smoothly from your heart center (the glowing core of your personal universe) to places like your thyroid and parathyroid 
glands (which are like control switches for your energy) and your navel center (the belly button spot that's your power hub). After the 3 minutes, take a big inhale, hold your 
breath for a moment to let the energy settle like stars aligning in the sky, then relax and exhale slowly.
</p>

<p>
This practice strengthens your heart's electromagnetic field, making it like a supercharged antenna that picks up good vibes from the cosmos and broadcasts your own radiant 
glow. Over time, it smooths your skin and lights up your eyes and face naturally, like how a well-tuned circuit in engineering makes everything shine without extra polish—no 
cosmetics needed, just your inner universe sparkling on its own.
</p>


<h3>Why the Cosmic Electrical Analogy Works</h3>
<p>
Picture the universe as a giant electrical circuit: black holes and galaxies hum with electromagnetic fields that oscillate in trigonometric waves, like sine functions graphing 
the rise and fall of cosmic tides (sin(θ) = opposite over hypotenuse, but in space, it's the pull between stars). Your body is a smaller version—your breath of fire creates 
those same wavy rhythms, charging your heart like a capacitor storing cosmic energy, while the hold and relax balance the flow, preventing overloads. It's beautiful because it 
connects your everyday self to the grand dance of the stars, turning simple sitting and breathing into a way to harmonize with the universe's hidden electricity. </p>

                <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
<section>
  <h2>Ayurvedic Perspective: Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands Using Trigonometry</h2>
  <p>
    Ayurveda interprets thyroid and parathyroid health through the balance of <strong>doshas</strong>, <strong>agni</strong>, and <strong>dhatus</strong>, with thyroid swellings mapped to the entity <em>Galaganda</em> and bone–mineral dynamics linked to <em>Asthi Dhatu</em> and tissue metabolism (<em>dhatvagni</em>). A helpful way to visualize this balance is the Pythagorean theorem, where overall endocrine homeostasis is the hypotenuse emerging from the squared contributions of thyroid-driven metabolic fire and parathyroid–Asthi Dhatu mineral regulation.
  </p>
  <h3>Ayurveda on Thyroid</h3>
  <p>
    Classical texts describe <strong>Galaganda</strong> as a pendulous swelling in the front of the neck, often correlated in modern discourse with goiter and thyroid enlargement. Ayurvedic analyses attribute Galaganda to <strong>Kapha</strong> predominance with <strong>Vata</strong> involvement and impaired digestive fire (<em>mandagni</em>), aligning with hypothyroid-like presentations. Traditional managements include purification measures, local applications, and formulations; modern Ayurvedic practice frequently employs <strong>Kanchanar/Kanchnar Guggulu</strong> and related guggul preparations for neck swellings and hypothyroid correlations.
  </p>
  <h3>Ayurveda on Parathyroid</h3>
  <p>
    While the parathyroids are not named in classical nosology, their modern role in raising serum calcium via parathyroid hormone (PTH) complements Ayurvedic mapping to <strong>Asthi Dhatu</strong> integrity and calcium-related tissue nourishment. Classical physiology frames bone health through <em>dhatu poshana krama</em> and <em>dhatvagni</em>, with Asthi Dhatu dependent on proper agni and upstream tissues, connecting mineral balance to systemic metabolism. In modern physiology, calcitonin from the thyroid lowers calcium and functionally counterbalances PTH, offering a biomedical bridge to the Ayurvedic notion of dynamic equilibrium among tissues and fires.
  </p>
  <h3>How They Relate</h3>
  <p>
    The thyroid and parathyroids are distinct glands with specific functions, yet they participate in a shared calcium axis via calcitonin and PTH that collectively shape systemic balance. This distinct-yet-coupled behavior mirrors Ayurveda’s view that multiple loci can contribute to a single homeostatic outcome through interacting doshas, agni, and dhatus.
  </p>
  <h3>Trigonometry Model</h3>
  <p>
    Let thyroid metabolic fire and parathyroid–Asthi mineral regulation be the orthogonal “legs” of a conceptual right triangle, and overall endocrine homeostasis (samatva/ojas expression) be the hypotenuse. The relationship can be expressed as 
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:1.1em;">a² + b² = c²</span>, 
    where <strong>a</strong> = thyroid-agni contribution, <strong>b</strong> = parathyroid–Asthi contribution, and <strong>c</strong> = integrated homeostasis; when one leg weakens, maintaining c requires reinforcing the other leg or restoring the weakened leg’s function. In biomedical terms, reduced thyroid drive or disrupted parathyroid-calcium handling can each disturb systemic balance, paralleling Ayurvedic emphasis on restoring agni and dhatu harmony to re-equilibrate the whole.

  </table>
  <h3>Practical Pointers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For thyroid swellings/Galaganda correlations, classical measures include bloodletting/nasya/lepas and internal oils, with contemporary use of Kanchanar/Kanchnar Guggulu in hypothyroid-like contexts.
    </li>
    <li>
      For bone–mineral balance, modern physiology notes that low calcium triggers more PTH, while Ayurveda emphasizes correcting agni and nourishing Asthi Dhatu alongside diet and sunlight practices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thinking with the triangle: strengthening agni (thyroid leg) or stabilizing Asthi Dhatu–calcium handling (parathyroid leg) both help restore the hypotenuse of integrated balance when one leg falters.
